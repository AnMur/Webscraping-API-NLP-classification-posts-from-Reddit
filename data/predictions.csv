feeling guilty getting a kid kicked out of daycare i guess i just need some reassurance that i am not the bad guy in this situation we take our year old and year old to daycare older one is just there for the summer they have been going there for almost three years and it has been amazing they are well taken care of and love being there we got a call today that a child had thrown a rock at our five year old and they had to call the paramedics my husband went to meet them and ended up taking him to our pcp who gave him five stitches and a diagnosis of a skull fracture he hasn t shown any neurological issues but we are keeping an eye on him causing us to cancel several weekend plans as well my husband was very upset when he got there because he felt like they were just brushing it off he signed an incident report where they called the other little boy a friend and i think that bothered him i went later in the day to pick up our daughter and spoke with the owner she was very apologetic but was hesitant to kick the other kid out i guess my husband asked what the repercussions would be i understand because three of my four kids are boys and very close in age they can get a little rough without much notice and have on more than one occasion embarrassed me with their poor choices have never hurt anyone i told the owner that i know things happen but it would be upsetting if this was the third or fourth incident with this child she called me this evening and told me they told the other family they could no longer come to daycare obviously my main goal is to make sure my son is fine he is and soaking up the attention but i feel so sad for the other family there are not very many daycare s in our area and i just feel for the parents i know i would be fuming if it was my child that did that any reassurance that i am not the a in this situation i am an ot so i have a good understanding of children and behaviors maybe that s why it is bothering me so much,0,0.08,0.92,0.08,0.08

almost year old won t use the potty hi everyone i have an almost year old and am months pregnant and i feel like i m at my wit s end he absolutely refuses to use the potty for a number he s generally fine for wees and doesn t have too many accidents but outright refuses to go for a poop on the potty he holds it and holds it until we put a nappy on him at night when he will happily go i ve tried everything i can think of to be supportive but i m starting to really be exhausted by this quite often he gets so constipated he can t go at night and then that has a knock on effect over the next few days and he ends up in extreme pain we ve had to take him to the walk in centre in the middle of the night before because it was so bad and we ve got some movicol infant laxative i guess which definitely helps to get things moving and solves the immediate issue as he will go in a nappy this was after we tried no nappy at night to see if it encouraged him to use the potty he tells me he needs to do a poop and runs about frantically then says it s gone and he can t go then repeat mins later all day every day he had an a episode at nursery last week who hadn t really seemed to understand the issue we have in the eve seems he s distracted at nursery and doesn t ever want to go and just waits until he s home and it s bedtime with his nappy but they were really shocked i guess i d like to know if anyone else has had a similar experience for context we don t shout or make a big deal when he says he needs to go we just take him to the potty and ask him to sit down i m past the point of if you do this you can have a treat etc but i m literally doing it all day and it s almost driving me to tears any suggestions i m waiting for a paediatrics referral but like everything during covid i expect it will take months,0,0.07,0.93,0.07,0.07
some frustrations with never let me go overall this is not a bad book if i were to give it a rating it d be or out of the premise is interesting the over arcing story keeps the reader curious and the societal commentary is apt however some many aspects of it annoy me i l try to avoid spoilers as i detail them below the protagonist s emotional intelligence is highly inconsistent at times she can tell what others feel even though something isn t obvious supposedly reading faces and in other scenes she won t be able to explain why certain behaviors occur this annoyance is exacerbated by the author s inability to show not tell and while i understand it s a limitation of storytelling in st person it still bothered me too often someone did a laugh why not say laughed or choose another verbs chuckle giggle chortle that s relevant for the given instance i know ishiguro usually avoids using so called advanced vocabulary but the expression did a laugh was used repeatedly in a tiring manner the prolonged manner of retelling memories is cumbersome i think it s deliberate a way to show how we always have hard time recalling past events but it either comes across as unnatural way of writing or unedited eg non chronological in a messy way in the second part of the book lack of age or indication of number of years passed a bit like my previous point i get it if it was set to show fuzziness of memories but it s harder to follow if we don t know whether the characters are in their mid s and reflect on events years back or if they are in their late s and talk about events from years back etcetera i m aware some of my comments might seem like nitpicking but it prevented me from fully enjoying it and to reiterate this isn t a bad book just disappointing last thought this is the second book of ishiguro i ve read there is a huge contrast to klara and the sun which to me is so much more precise in its writing and gives a smoother reading experience maybe my expectations were too high,1,0.94,0.06,0.94,0.06000000000000005
thanks for all the recommendations i am fairly new to reading literature i have read lots of biographies and non fiction stuff i went through this subreddit and bought the following books crime and punishment meditations and other metaphysical writings the oxford inheritance the tattooist of auschwitz great expectations and some more i have completed the number and currently on number i just have to say that after reading these books you get to feel your emotions in a different way than before you get this weird clarity in your thoughts you might have heard about how a human can change his way of thinking when they start leaning a new language it is similar sorts of thing you read through these dreadful passage of sorrow and pain and it is just amazing to picture a different era where only getting a cup of milk and bread seems like a luxury to know what i am talking about just read the first two chapters of crime and punishment books provide a stillness and calmness my goal is to read around books before i turn currently thanks to everyone for this great subreddit and all the content you guys create,1,0.94,0.06,0.94,0.06000000000000005

anxious people by fredrik backman was touching throughout the novel and totally worth reading i m not sure i d title the book anxious people after having read it through more like all the lonely people or bridges but whatever the book will be on my keep it shelf for a very long time backman i felt did a stunning job portraying people as well people neither good nor bad but instead full of mistakes misgivings and uncertainties despite all that love finds a way and not the sappy shit but the earnest way every day humans try and fail and try again to love,1,0.93,0.07,0.93,0.06999999999999995
the darkness outside us by eliot schrefer i m starting to realize i have a problem with diving head first into stories the first time i did so was with the first fifteen lives of harry august by catherine webb i bought it on a whim and ended up staying up all night reading it all pages despite having work the next morning while it wasn t over night i just did it again with the darkness outside us by eliot schrefer i couldn t keep my eyes off my screen and even while i had to take a short break i couldn t stop theorizing about what was going to happen i won t make this a spoiler post but the book opens as a teenager ambrose cust awakens on a damaged ship to the sound of the ship s ai which uses his mega corporation ceo mother s voice no less he s tasked with fixing the ship s issues before its arrival at saturn s moon titan where he and another teenager from the only other country on earth kodiak celius will render assistance to ambrose s sister minerva who had previously set out to begin a colony but that is only the beginning and though some might think it drags it gets so good while it does use the enemies to lovers trope in a gay capacity it was well executed there s no explicit sex but it s clear it happens it s also marked as ya fiction but i d argue that s only because the characters are after binge reading it i m just kind of mentally fried i enjoyed it so much that i was reeling from the conclusion i really hope i can bring attention to this book and have some discussions about it,1,0.87,0.13,0.87,0.13

how often do people have abortion we have a mo old well turns out i m pregnant again i have really mixed feelings about this on the one hand it s a new life and they are cute once they get to the toddler stage also the thought of ending a pregnancy feels cruel i also wonder if having a sibling would help my older one to get more adjusted on the other hand just thinking about childcare for a baby and toddler makes me seriously hopeless plus i worry that as adults it s hit or miss if they are even going to be close i don t want to do all the work for nothing i was also an only child and i worry i can t give as much attention to the kids if i was caring for and i would just do a mediocre job with both plus they d have to share resources time etc the thought of continuing with the pregnancy just gives me so much anxiety i just want to hide in bed i don t even want to interact with my toddler but i feel like there is such a cultural stigma against abortion i feel like i would be cruel to do it i wish we were more careful the decision would ve been so much easier have anyone had experience deciding to get an abortion or keep the baby what made you decide,0,0.08,0.92,0.08,0.08

i loved andy weir s project hail mary but i did have one problem spoilers just so you all know i absolutely loved the martian when it came out and it immediately put andy weir on my lookout list for new content then artemis came out and i was disappointed when it didn t live up to my expectations but that s a post for another time so when i heard that another weir novel was coming out i was a bit skeptical wondering how well i would like it i m happy to report that the novel was great and i couldn t put it down however there s one point about the novel that i just can t get off of my mind my problem is with rocky s alien species the eridians i m annoyed at how familiar they feel how similar to mankind they seem to be i loved the imagination and creativity that went into coming up with the astrophage because it was a truly unique and new kind of alien life form to explore it was a twist on the life we are familiar with acting in ways we didn t think would be possible they really got you excited wondering what other new and strange abilities you d discover about them i was excited when rocky was introduced because i expected that same kind of creativity to show up with his species however aside from how alien his physiology is his personality culture etc didn t really manifest itself that differently from the way human culture and personality does he has the same emotional reactions to the situations he and grace are put in his species is described as having essentially monogamous relationships which is uncommon for the overwhelming majority of species on earth even if you include humans in that consideration furthermore eridians don t appear to have any real reason to have such intimate relationships and their development and education even seem similar to humans grace is teaching a rowdy bunch of eridian kid s in a classroom setting at the end of the novel i m not saying that i hated rocky s character or his species far from it i found his character very entertaining i m also not saying that there s nothing about the species and their culture that appear alien in the novel there most certainly are for example how they eat their need to be watched while they sleep etc but it s not enough to shake this feeling that i m just watching a human mind in a different body i think it would have made for an even better novel if weir could have made the eridians a bit more more alien to humans and see how grace handled overcoming the obstacles it presented i know there are ways to justify why weir chose to write the eridians the way he did i can think of plenty of reasons myself i just wish he had chosen to go a different route but maybe that s too much ask of from an already good novel,1,0.63,0.37,0.63,0.37
feeling like i havent had any good parental figure growing up so my parents are separated and i ve been living with my mum ever since i was while my dad lived my grandparents my parents have a really bad relationship and they cannot have a conversation without arguing so after a while they stopped talking altogether my mum is a very loving mother who overworries all the time and constantly restricts both me and my brother eg sometimes ill ask her if i can go out and she ll just say no with the reason being that she s the mother and she says so which always enrages my brother and i she also has a very bad temper along with being extremely sensitive and hypocritical i could go on but that along with many other reasons causes me and my brother to not have a close relationship with her and even sparked resentment in us although i know she loves us deeply since we never really spent time with our father and he just paid for our education and other things we haven t really been able to get to know him as a result my brother and i never blamed him for leaving our family and not making the effort to meet us due to his strained r s with our mother we never held it against him when he never bothered to return our calls when we were younger and would flippantly tell us to go to sleep when we cried saying we missed him i always made excuses for his absence and it was not until recently when i began to doubt whether he really loved me or was paying for our upbringing to appease my fiesty mother what happened was that my dad told my brother and i that he was going to give us an allowance for university my brother entered uni a year earlier and ill be going in this year however he directly transferred to my brother and to me which left me with a day for meals when i first found out i didnt want to believe that he was being biased but its been slowly getting to me that my impression of my father was based purely on what i imagined just feeling extremely lost right now and the fact that i have no emotional support in my family is taking a toll on my mental health too i m not sure what to think or how to act with this information because its not the first time my dad has shown biasedness to my brother he refused to get me a laptop for school but has bought my brother laptops and a desktop and lets be fair he too left my brother crying when he exited our family without a sign of guilt so i doubt his love for my brother too i love my brother and i know he trusts my dad i dont want him getting hurt in the end,0,0.1,0.9,0.1,0.1

question about fig trees in jose saramago s the gospel according to jesus christ really enjoying this book it s a unique take on jesus life and the translation by giovanni pontiero is excellent extra points for adding depth to the world by bringing to the fore the plight of women living during that time something sorely missing in the bible i m on the beginning few pages where mary is pregnant with jesus and her and joseph are on their way to bethlehem on reaching there joseph puts her under the shade of a fig tree because she has started having pre contraction pains after a while he takes her out of there to save mary from the deadly shade of the fig tree which was slowly killing her an unforgivable mistake for which they must share the blame for fig trees abound in this land and they ought to have known better does anyone know why or how the shadow of the fig tree was dangerous to mary the only biblical significance that i could find on my own was that jesus once cursed a fig tree for not bearing fruits but at this point he hasn t been born yet,1,0.77,0.23,0.77,0.22999999999999998

are my nephews autistic my twin nephews are months old and there appear to be quite a few signs of autism the obvious one is they never speak a word other than da to everything they also always appear to be blank faced or expressionless all the time they were born at weeks one of them is extremely oversized and makes high pitched squeals all of the time the other one constantly holds cars tons of them and all he wants to do is spin the wheels he also had very bad muscle stiffness issues early in infancy they also never babble and never have it s always sort of a grunt squeal or hum also one of them holds his hand in the air and hums while wiggling his fingers the entire time he eats their mom finds hope in that they grunt and growl when asked to mimic animals and one of them will point to blue or green in a book when asked i guess my question is what other discernible signs should one look for not responding to name and eye contact doesn t seem reliable because i know tons of kids who don t also is there a great piece of evidence that would indicate this as a speech delay instead of autism,0,0.13,0.87,0.13,0.13

unpopular opinion we don t need likeable characters to like a book so i am really intrigued by this in most book reviews that i see including movies people complain if a character is likeable or not i don t understand so if a character isn t likeable this ruins the whole book for example i read a book about a werewolf terrorizing a small city but i never cared if a character was likeable or not the fact thet the book was about a werewolf with good tension and horror makes the book very interesting to me and this is for every book that i read i don t need to like a character to like the story and there are characters who are assholes that i love for example roman godfrey from the book hemlock grove another example looking for alaska when i read the book i never tought that a character was cool or not only the fact that the story was about adolescence from a interesting perspective made the book interesting to me i want to hear your opinion because i confess that i am feeling a little crazy after all of this i can t be the only person on the planet who think like this,1,0.99,0.01,0.99,0.010000000000000009

project hail mary was even better than the martian when i posted on this sub about having read the martian and loved it almost every commenter told me to read phm and i am grateful for that i didn t know much about this book going into it i only knew that it had an intelligent alien in it i don t know what i was expecting but it turned out to be even better the plot was an absolute banger the premise about alien microbes threatening humanity s existence is something i have seen before but never like this also the fact that eridians are less advanced they hadn t worked out relativistic physics and whatnot than humans was kinda new to me so that was a pleasant surprise i loved the friendship dynamic between ryland and rocky it was absolutely adorable my only complaint is that the ending could ve been done better i realize this might be an unpopular opinion but i really wanted ryland to go back to earth i m not particularly mad about it to the point of hating it but y know just saying one more thing i could not have been the only one to imagine the interstellar docking sequence music when the hail mary was spinning out of control over adrian right right what were your thoughts on the book,1,0.7,0.3,0.7,0.30000000000000004

at loss about what to do with baby s sleep warning this will probably get venty ranty and long sorry in advance my son is almost months old he s been sleeping in his room since he was about months old lately things have gotten worse my wife and me both agree that we need to fix it somehow but we don t know how nor do we exactly agree about what to do we essentially have two issues first is that our son won t sleep unless his mother cuddles him until he falls asleep this is a thing that we should have addressed much sooner but we didn t for a few reasons first off my wife likes it when it works she ll cuddle him for or minutes and he ll fall asleep the downside is that when it doesn t it s stressfull and it might go on for two hours without any of us parents being able to enjoy some time togheter i feel like i m to blame here because i never pushed to share this bedtime duty my wife liked it my son liked it and i found trying to get him to sleep very stressful it also seemed natural that she would do it since she took months off work when our son was born while i didn t have the choice i m a lawyer and work full time at my firm so i need to be there whenever i tried to put him to bed over the course of the past months it has never worked he will be happy and cheerful that i m there and just play and never get in the mindset of ok i gotta sleep now doesn t help that stupid as it sounds my son likes to stroke my wife s hair to relax himself to sleep and he can t do that with me cause i m bald anyway this can get pretty bad because my wife gets obviously quite tired whenever there s a few bad days in a row she works full time too now also my wife is the one that handles most instances of our son waking up in the middle of the night it s not that i wouldn t if fact i do get out of bed and try to handle it succesfully too if it s a simple thing such as putting the pacifier back in his mouth but if he s fully awake he won t go back to sleep with me also i m a very heavy sleeper so whenever our son cries or fusses she will generally wake up much sooner than me i have no control over this it just takes a lot of noise to wake me up i guess that it probably sounds like i m not willing to do my share of parenting duty but i assure you i m a very involved father i spend pretty much almost every moment when i m home and my son is out of bed with him the only thing i do for myself is maybe a half hour workout in the living room a few days a week i ve foregone everything else i won t watch tv or read books or play videogames when he s active i ll be with him and spend time with him away from my phone the only thing i don t do is the sleep thing and i reiterate it is in no small part because my wife likes to do it for instance she won t give me the baby monitor when we re in bed she wants to keep it close by to check whenever she feels like now onto the second issue my wife and son went on a week long trip last week with my in laws i managed to take days off then went home during that time my son slept in the same room as my wife small hotel room in a kiddie bed i think he liked it way too much sleeping close to his parents because ever since they came back last thursday he will wake up around midnight and refuse to go to back to sleep in his bad my wife was unable to break him because she was quite tired and couldn t muster spending maybe one hour of efforts to get him to fall back asleep in his bed which i understand so the solution was to bring him to bed with us which promptly calmed him down however it s been nights in a row of our son spending most of the night in bed with us and we don t want this apparently there s also a form of sleep regression when babies start walking which our son did a couple of weeks ago so that may be a factor whatever it is this cannot keep happening because as much as i am a heavy sleeper i sleep like crap when our son is in bed with us he ll be on my side all the time i worry about moving so and so and it s just not good i can t fall into deep sleep besides neither me nor my wife want a co sleeping situation we bought the book the sleepeasy solution a couple of months ago we tried for two days back then the first day it seemed to work nicely he was crying but not too much until food delivery rang the bell and he had a meltdown second day he started crying and hyperventilating right when my wife put him in his bed so we dropped it neither of us enjoys our son screaming like he s about to die it s excruciating and we just couldn t go through with it also my wife isn t on board with this because as i said she likes putting him to sleep as she always did and our son crying got her very bitter towards me yesterday we tried the book method again initially it seemed to work well as our son fell asleep in about minutes he did wake up around midnight tho and despite us insisting with the method go into his room talk to him calmly not pick him up follow the intervals to a t he didn t fall asleep for more than two hours we couldn t sleep one bit while he was screaming in the room next to us i felt like absolute shit because i feel responsible for this since i was never able to get him to sleep and my wife resents me for being in favor of trying this which she never was ok with and it was just garbage he fell asleep around o clock and woke up again around by this time we decided to get him into our bed because we honestly couldn t handle spending the rest of the night without any sleep and with our son screaming in fetal position in a corner of his bed bad sleep is better than no sleep and being eaten alive by guilt we don t know what to do the book method which is a kind of ferber method iiuc seemed to work well when he needed to go to sleep but it was horrible the rest of the night if he kept screaming for hours in the middle of the night we just feel that maybe this isn t right for him not every method is guaranteed to work with every child afterall i know most sources say that you should stick with a strategy for a few days before you make up your mind but it s so cruel and painful i don t think we can handle another night like this not to forget mostly sleepless too i m a zombie at work today in fact i just spent a huge chunk of time typing this post because i can t handle doing work stuff i m sure my wife is in as much trouble as i am i m looking for some advice even if it s drop sleep training and just go to sleep on the couch which i am seriously considering right now if you think we brought this upon ourselves you re probably right but we re stressed sleep deprived and bitter towards each other we re doing our best and try to get this to work for ourselves and our son but we don t know what to do,0,0.03,0.97,0.03,0.03

call of the wild and white fang by jack london i just read call of the wild and white fang two adventure stories by jack london i did not know what i was even getting into to sum it up if you want a picture of jack london imagine a boot stamping on a dogs face forever these books were brutal poor buck and white fang reading both of them being beat into submission turned into viscous fighting dogs starved and strained to beyond human limits again and again was difficult still one cannot knock the vivid images that london captures he really gave an excellent perspective to each dog with both animals being totally separate characters like buck from cotw is a formerly domestic dog that is kidnapped and turned into a sled dog from there he essentially becomes an berhund dominating every dog he comes across in a hellish descent into madness and ascent to supremacy white fang meanwhile is almost pure unadulterated wildness a wolf who is taken from the wild and absolutely oppressed into slavish and resentful submission all his life from the time he is a diminutive puppy to when he is full grown i loved all the description of ancestor memories in cotw buck thinking to himself as he stares at his master across a campfire how his distant wolf ancestors saw a similar creature hairy and exposed hunched over a fire always looking over his back and armed with a simple club whereas buck and his kin evolved to an almost physical supremacy humanity evolved in quite a different direction and it seems not so long ago that buck may have considered this man beast as prey that was an interesting angle that i m glad cotw explored but white fang went in almost the total opposite direction of that white fang looks at humans as gods from a primordial instinct he is lesser and thus he must submit to humanity it is this lack of self fulfillment from white fang that drives most of his tragic life at almost no point does he trust humanity but he submits to them almost purely out of instinct and that is really quite tragic good stories i didn t expect these books to be as existential as they were it was honestly quite surprising what did you think of these stories,1,0.98,0.02,0.98,0.020000000000000018
romantic wrongness test i am someone who massively struggles at understanding romantic situations actions and whats acceptable without deep thought while thats not been a problem irl its a pretty big problem when it comes to fiction so i have developed a simple test to judge if there is something wrong with a situation that i should think further about or if i should just accept it and continue reading watching i just imagine all the different gender variations of the romance and if the receiver of the romantic action was not interested didn t like the person initiating if under any of the variations or interest no i get a feeling of thatd be kinda creepy or any sense of wrongness i try to put further time into figuring out what might be wrong there i would say my test is pretty effective but i feel like it could be more effective and clinical the use of gender doesnt seem like it should be a necessary thing for me to do but i cant find a substitute for it that isnt just actually learn how this shit works does anyone have their own wrongness test or variables that could be added to mine a basic example would be literally any of the surprise kiss as a way of confessing or the kissing them staring at them in their sleep trope that show up way to often if the receiver is uninterested in the initiator then at best its a massive violation of personal space and not at all romantic i havent seen this trope much since i stopped reading ya light novels thankfully,1,0.77,0.23,0.77,0.22999999999999998

racism some days ago we re in a restaurant with a great playground with a woman taking care of the kids when we got there there was only one little girl of the same age as my daughter years old we left her playing with the girl and kept an eye from our table after some time a little black girl appeared and my wife noticed that both my daughter and the other girl were mistreating her my wife went there to see what was happening and they were being mean saying that she couldn t play there and stuff like that my wife was livid since my daughter is always very kind and asked her what was going on she said that the girl couldn t play there and my wife asked why then she said she doesn t know and looked at the other girl then the other girl started screaming saying that she couldn t play there my wife talked to my daughter first explaining that she couldn t be mean to the girl and that they could be friends and the other girl kept being mean my wife then proceeded to talk to the other girl and somehow convinced her to stop and let the girl play in the end the three of them played together it seems that the first girl never mentioned explicitly but i guess it was some sort of racism that she learned from her parents even though she probably doesn t even understand why after all both my daughter and her are white and she was kind to my daughter the whole time i hope it was just a coincidence because it s sad if the little girl has racist parents to the point of making her do that in such a young age also it was crazy to see how easy a kid simply follows other kids behaviors even though they have no idea why at least it worked out in the end thanks to my wife i hope we do our best to avoid seeing our kid ever mistreating anyone again even if she sees someone doing it,0,0.06,0.94,0.06,0.06

extreme tension in the family over taking in our nieces around a month ago my husband s estranged sister and her husband passed away in an accident they had two children f and f but didn t establish guardianship with anyone before they died though their grandmother lives nearby she s in her late eighties and in no state to take in two young children as a result it seems that guardianship is going to us unless we decline however both my husband and i are reluctant though for different reasons my husband was never enthusiastic about children we had one daughter f and he s a great father but i know he doesn t want to go through the process again i on the other hand am terrified that taking in these two children would completely destroy our relationship with our daughter and potentially our family i also just began to work again since f is much more self sufficient and i can t imagine going back to a full sahm again at the same time i feel like we have a responsibility to our two nieces has anyone else been in this situation,0,0.11,0.89,0.11,0.11

such low expectations my wife went to a bachelorette party bridal shower this past weekend and i was left home with my three little boys m m m from saturday to sunday night obviously the toddler stage is pretty chaotic and frustrating at times but you just have to power through so i had no issues with my wife taking a weekend away my wife apparently got comments from my cousins that they couldn t believe i let her have a weekend off away from the kids and they asked if she was worried at all to leave them in only my care it frustrated me that people would think that i am not capable of watching my own children by myself for an extended period of time is the expectation of my abilities as a father that low should it not be common that the parenting duties are split fairly i ve gotten comments before from people saying that i m such a good dad for even being cognitive of how much time my wife and i each get time away from the kids to recharge shouldn t that be the fucking bare minimum isn t the point of being in a partnership to share the workload of parenting and not put it solely on one person everyone needs time to recharge idk why this time specifically bothered me so much it just felt like people thought i was a shit parent,0,0.08,0.92,0.08,0.08

any advice to read effectively beginner hi so i am year old who is wanting to read i ve tried to read years ago but never disciplined myself enough to read any of the books i ve bought however i took the courage and discipline myself enough to almost finish a page book currently on page within almost a week sadly sometime i enjoy reading the book and other times i m bored my issue is that even when i m in interest i usually forget what i have read which sometimes frustrates me i ve watched videos and tried all of them majority has helped me drastically but there s an underlying issue which i can t seem to fix for which is reading a book in monologue instead of using my imagination understanding the concept of reading a book in monologue made me realize i m just reading the words and that is really it i m not creating any sort of imagery for me to understand the books i really want to improve my reading and read effectively and would to love hear some advice of improving on reading and also avoiding monologue thank you,1,0.78,0.22,0.78,0.21999999999999997
my ride or die by leslie cohen might be underrated someone on here was looking for more posts about underrated books and i said when i read an underrated book i d let them know so here it is it only has stars on goodreads and i m really not sure where i came across the summary initially and felt compelled to pick it up probably buzzfeed or something at any rate i haven t laughed out loud reading a book in a while and i did at various points throughout this book the main characters were both relatable despite being very different people they both felt like they could be real people in your own life i think women will likely appreciate this book more than men it does a great job of portraying female friendships and all the highs and lows that can go along with those i also found her writing style refreshing she really seemed to write the way a lot of people think and speak as opposed to trying to write more formally that s hard to do without coming across as bad writing or seeming unpolished but i think she may have just pulled it off she also did a good job of writing in the voice of two distinct characters which is also quite hard to do if you re looking for a quick fun read about female friendships give it a try,1,0.98,0.02,0.98,0.020000000000000018

i hate bedtime my daughter is three and a half i also think she might be half monster some kind of demon possesses her every evening and turns bedtime into a complete nightmare i mean we re talking about a kid who is normally sweet cuddly creative smart and just really wonderful i don t want to make her sound like she never pushes boundaries but she s really a joy to be around except at night the last couple of nights have been especially terrible well really the last several weeks she just won t accept when it s time to stay in her room she comes racing out giggling or say she needs the potty but then actually run to her toys in the living room or drape a sheet over herself and lie on the kitchen floor pretending to be a ghost we ll do the supernanny thing of putting her back in her room with less and less communication each time doesn t matter out she pops again so then we began confiscating toys which just caused meltdowns super fun at at night then we tried locking her in her room which we ve always been reluctant to do because what if she needs the bathroom we told her she could call to come out if she needed the bathroom well obviously she cried wolf dozens of times turning that into just another part of the game and as for the last two days well once her door was locked she just started peeing in her room literally taking her pullup off pissing on the floor and then putting her pullup back on and then screaming for us and announcing proudly that she peed like some kind of fucking psycho and yes i know i m not supposed to talk about my kid that way but what the actual fuck she responds to nothing not kindness not silence not punishments in her head there s only two scenarios either she gets to keep playing with us for three hours after her bedtime or she will instead scream and whine and piss all over her room for three hours after bedtime either way our evening and chance for adult time is totalled it s also every single night regardless of what we ve done that day whether she s had a nap or not whether she s exhausted or not regardless regardless regardless the one thing we ve tried to keep constant is her actual bedtime routine i think we clearly need to change that my husband thinks her bedtime should be later so she s more tired i think that would backfire and it should be earlier and by that i mean it should start at the same time but he needs to cut the fun parts of bedtime short i m going to throw him under the bus a bit here because he usually does bedtime and i just think the way he does it is not good he lets her watch a cartoon on his tablet then reads a dozen books to her and lets her climb on him while he does it and that s all before she even has to get in her pajamas or brush her teeth i ve told him a million times that i think it just wires her up and drags everything on too long on the occasions when he s out of the house i might let her watch a cartoon since she s used to that now but then she has to get dressed brush her teeth and lie in the bed tucked in while i read a maximum of three books she is much calmer not perfect but calmer i ve told my husband this but it just hasn t clicked i think he just enjoys the fun parts of bedtime too much because it is fun to read and to hear her laugh as she plays and tries to tickle him but it also wires her up he finally admitted tonight that he thinks he should not do screen time with her right before bed i ve been refusing to clean up the pee so he s been doing that and maybe that s why he s finally realizing he should make a change and for anyone whose knee jerk response is well if she s better at bedtime for you than for him then why don t you do it yourself the answer is because bedtime is often the main part of the day that he sees her i don t fault him for wanting that time i ve expressed my opinions on his bedtime ritual many many times but i don t control how he parents nor should i this is not a sitcom situation where the incompetent man has to have the eye rolling woman step in and take over we ll come up with and and implement a solution together at this rate possibly an exorcism i don t know how long this demon stage lasts but i m so so over it,0,0.15,0.85,0.15,0.15

how do my wife and i tell our yr old that i am her step dad my step daughter was a little over years old when i met my wife she called me by my name back then but started calling me dad by the time she was we had moved in together by then my wife and i never taught her to call me that and it came out very naturally of her she used to call her biological father daddy when she was little he had very less interest in being a father which was the major reason why my wife and him broke up so he moved back to his home country and saw her only times since then the last time he saw my daughter was almost years ago my daughter has a very little memory of him now she knows that there was a man she called daddy but she doesn t know why or who he actually is to her she has brought him up a couple times in the last few months and we haven t had the heart to explain the truth to her we also recently saw one of our relatives after a year of stay at home who intentionally or unintentionally brought up her father to my daughter when they were alone with her which confused my daughter and again she asked about what that relative meant we have thought about this thing a lot for the last couple years of how we are going to break the truth to my daughter without leaving her fully confused or without her starting to hate me or her mother but we are clueless to her i am her dad and to me she is my daughter my first child and she always will be but that doesn t change the sad reality sooner or later she will figure this out herself her last name is different i am a different ethnicity from her parents and a few other factors involved her biological father also hasn t spoken to her in the last two years so we also don t want him to make a contact with her out of nowhere without us having a conversation with her first i am really looking for some serious advice on how to take this step and how exactly it should be done i am very concerned about my daughter s mental health and behavior and don t want it to be affected by doing it the wrong way i appreciate any responses in advance and will be happy to answer any questions,0,0.05,0.95,0.05,0.05

why do we label books by age group recently i ve started getting in to brandon sandersons series i m on the fourth book of the stormlight archive and i ve started the sequel series of the mistborn trilogy the series is so old that i can t justify buying the series new one thing i ve noticed is that sandersons series are remarkably difficult to find at the used book stores and when i do find them they re usually grouped with the ya novels amp x b compared to the usual mystery serials i read preston amp child and baldacci i feel like sanderson handles far more adult subject matter and yet all of his books are grouped in ya in fact i ve read some jack reacher novels too and i find them to be comically childish compared the stormlight archives or rothfuss s kingkiller chronicles amp x b i ve also seen some really adult material in the ya section as well kite runner diary of a part time indian and even early stephen king i just wonder when we started labeling books as ya even though apparently adult books are far more immature amp x b don t get me wrong i like how jack reacher kills people with his bare hands and no one judges him for it i just don t see how that s any different than when people get slaughtered with a magical sword in the stormlight archive they re both equally fantastical to my mind,1,0.78,0.22,0.78,0.21999999999999997

how to feed my f daughter f post eating disorder hello guys i m currently around months pregnant and as the due date is coming close i m having increasing anxiety on how to raise my child particularly around eating as a young girl i was pretty overweight and i remember being as young as and having low self esteem and trying to lose weight i don t blame my parents for this as they tried their best to raise me in a new foreign country and are human too for example my parents grew up never learning or hearing about eating disorders and with not a lot of money so they took pride in being able to feed me a lot of food and got upset if i wasted it they never understood how this could be harmful also i didn t enjoy my ethnic food as a child and was more attracted to unhealthy choices like fast food so my mom would use a lot of butter and sugar to make the ethnic food more appealing to me i also remember at one point my mom didn t know what protein shakes were and thought they were chocolate milk and would feed it to us pretty regularly without realizing it after a while of being adjusted here my parents sort of let me control my own food intake because i learned enough in school to know how to eat healthily but this ended up triggering a long battle with restrictive eating and counting calories i lost the weight pretty fast after i had control over my food and now i can t even look at food without being able to keep track of the calories and mentally log them i don t even see food the same way it s just calories to me that i mix and match to meet a certain goal even pregnant i just see food as macros and calories and i use it to make sure i m hitting a certain goal to keep my baby and me safe i don t want to pass these habits down to my daughter i remember how happy food used to make me and how excited i was to try new things or eat at new restaurants but now i avoid places that don t publish caloric menus i don t want her to grow up like that but i don t have an example of what good food habits are because my parents struggled just as much as i did just in different ways i don t even know how i ll approach feeding her once she starts on solid food i m just lost and i spoke to my doctors about this and they just gave me estimated portion sizes but i m just confused i don t want my daughter to struggle with food or have bad self esteem because of my mistakes i see videos on the internet of people packing their kid s food but how do they know that it s enough or too much how does that come so naturally to new parents,0,0.11,0.89,0.11,0.11

have you ever read alissa nutting s tampa i saw this book recommended online somewhere about a something female teacher who has an obsession with year old boys amp does everything in her power to sleep with them people drawn lots of comparisons with lolita amp the main character of the book named celeste is a highly manipulative sociopath the book is very thought provoking in regards to the double standards that surround gender amp i do have to admit that the book has some highly erotic very sexual smutty scenes that appeal to the teenage boy i used to be lol amp i would imagine some female readers would find the smutty erotica enjoyable too but some may also be unwilling to read the book because of its subject matter i think if you re willing to give it a try alissa nutting s tampa is a brilliant although definitely not perfect social commentary on how society views sexual predators based on gender amp an entertaining read,1,0.51,0.49,0.51,0.49

spouse training for marathon while we raise our infant first i totally support my partners desire to run in a marathon it s important everyone gets some personal time away from being a parent but training to run a marathon is time demanding we re talking hour runs almost every day and hour runs at least once a week escalating to longer and longer runs and as much as it may feel like work it is a leisure time activity my spouse and i both work full time jobs so our son needs to get dropped off at daycare at and picked up at we alternate schedules working later or earlier to get our work responsibilities covered and we have been blessed by the covid shift to work from home however both our jobs require commuting at least times a week and our commute takes an hour both ways things are complicated stuff came to a head this morning my partner was taking the pre day care responsibilities and i was to take the drop off shift then i had to commute to be at a meeting at am partner is working from home today but wanted to get a run in i had to shower and dress and everything for work some baby food got spilled on the rug while making a handoff of dirty dishes and before you know it we are having a spirited discussion where partner is blaming me for spilling the food i m upset about always being blamed for everything partner is upset because they have done everything this morning and they promptly leave to go on a run i clean up the mess dress our son take him to daycare get home grab my work stuff and am off on my hour commute to work i feel like it s just a stress argument and the source of the added stress lately is that partner wants to dedicate a lot of time to training it must seem like all they do is work their butt off to train then work their butt off to take care of baby and they never get a break but i deserve a break too even if it is to do bs things like drink a cold beer outside or play a video game for an hour so if they take an hour run where i take care of baby then i get an hour to do whatever i want to do but it s an hour that i rarely take because i don t need a full hour every day and hours a few times a week for leisure i ve tried to talk to partner before about the added stress training for a marathon will add to our relationship and responsibilities but i can t say the words right and they always thinks i m trying to make them feel guilty there s also the added stress that they feel to get back into pre baby fitness that i do not feel so somehow when we have this conversation it s like i m condemning them to being fat forever but i feel like there s a big difference between getting in shape and getting in marathon shape i ve also tried to suggest that they run after baby is asleep or before baby wakes up or while baby is at daycare but it s either too dark out or too hot to be running at those times sorry for the rambling post but if there is any advice you could offer for how to talk about these things in a sensitive way it would be appreciated,0,0.04,0.96,0.04,0.04
unpopular opinion agatha christie is overrated i know that is an unpopular opinion i want to say it again i know that this is an unpopular opinion i also want to add that i have only read two of christie s works and there were none and murder on the orient express the reason i haven t read any more of them is because these two repeatedly recommended and seemingly well regarded books were underwhelming and yes overrated while there is plenty of intrigue and the premises were unique the books seemed to follow a similar model more than anything i disliked the endings the mystery is revealed to be something quite improbable funnily enough i guessed whodunnit in one of the reads within the first few chapters it was the how that i couldn t get and then i found the how to be cartoonish i thought the other ending was quite lazy although i m sure it was a novel concept it s just that original concepts and novelty don t detract from the fact that they re not as great as people say and don t get me wrong i enjoyed reading these two books i might even read some more they were for me page turners even because of the intrigue i just don t think they re these timeless masterpieces,1,0.94,0.06,0.94,0.06000000000000005
gt spoiler here lt ending of the burning white ruined the series don t get me wrong i have read everything brent weeks has written and absolutely loved them but the ending of the burning white ruined the series for me all throughout the series every success was won through sacrifice and endurance i loved the gritty feel of the books gavin was mutilated and paid over and over again for the success he achieved but then at the end all the hardships the characters endured were overwritten by orhalam saving the day and undoing all the suffering they had to endure he brought kip back to life restored gavin s vision and even turned andross into a decent person it just seemed like blatant christian propaganda rather than a satisfying end to a five book series i just feel very let down i liken it almost to the twilight series although the lightbringer series was much better written where at the end the protagonist had to give up nothing and got everything she wanted,1,0.9,0.1,0.9,0.09999999999999998
do you find that negative reviews have an extreme influence on your enjoyment of a book not only do they point out all the flaws which i can t help but notice but they almost cause me to feel naive for potentially just enjoying it without picking up on said flaws it s a horrible mindset and i hate to give some carping critical cuntbag that much power over my experience reading or any artistic medium for that matter but it s like once they ve incepted the seeds out doubt into my mind the battle is already lost do you bother reading specific reviews before diving into a book if so do you place much credence in their sentiment,1,0.89,0.11,0.89,0.10999999999999999

two year old needed stitches above her eye about two weeks ago my sister was watching my two year old at the park and she ran in front of the swings and was kicked in the face by another child at the er they needed to stitch her laceration up which started from her forehead and extended down through her eyebrow on the right side i am very concerned now that this could result in permanent disfiguration could stitching the wound together have pulled on the skin above her right eye and changed its shape such as lifting the skin above her eyelid i m worried that she could have permanent eye asymmetry because of this although everyone says i m paranoid i keep wondering how it would be different if the wound was allowed to heal on its own,0,0.06,0.94,0.06,0.06

the lovely bones review i finished reading it yesterday and the ending felt kind of really random and bad written it s a good book and i enjoyed it but at times it felt like it stranded too far from the main plot and didn t focus enough on the main character plus that ending was just disappointing in my opinion first ruth getting run over by harvey for seemingly no reason at all then harvey dying in a ridiculously sudden way just so that the readers could get any closure at all and even after that it doesn t explain what happens to susie like does she move on and dies for good or does she just wait in her heaven until she can finally meet all her family members it just screamed lack of ideas and laziness to me i m curious to hear other readers opinions about it,1,0.94,0.06,0.94,0.06000000000000005

my experience with house of leaves post contains spoilers for house of leaves despite the book being over years old at this point it seems to have seen a resurgence in popularity recently and given the fact that i am nearing the end of college and approaching a new phase in my life it seemed like the right time people often describe the book as life changing the scariest they ve ever read life saving and occasionally life ruining i found the book appealing both thematically and at a purely narrative level however i found that only the latter really resonated with me as a narrative i found the book to be a lot of fun and a pretty quick read even with the lengthy footnotes and referenced appendices it didn t unsettle me as much as i hoped but the story s romanticism made it enjoyable and rewarding regardless all that being said and despite my best efforts the book didn t make me feel anything the themes of mortality faith fear and connection weren t lost on me but they also didn t give me pause for even a moment other pieces of art have impacted me before and they don t necessarily need to be especially erudite to do so the old man and the sea is a book that i carry with me everywhere and reread religiously more relevant is the movie stalker by andre tarkovsky which i count as the most impactful piece of media i have ever seen given their similarities i had hoped that house of leaves might have a similar impact on me or at least evoke some of the same feelings but it only rarely did ultimately i think that the book is a very entertaining literary achievement but it did not touch me in the way it did others and i wish that i knew why also my enjoyment was slightly dampened by what i saw as a slightly regressive approach to the female characters the vast majority exist only to be objectified and the only one who isn t serves as an obstacle to the protagonist of the story the book defends her actions and treats her much more sympathetically towards the finale but it for the most part paints her as unfaithful and unsupportive even as it admonishes such characterization in the story if this treatment of women was an intentional commentary the nuance was lost on me,1,0.75,0.25,0.75,0.25

somewhat helpless auntie i have no kids of my own but have a year old niece who s my absolute world we live in different countries and as i had not seen her since before the pandemic i jumped at the opportunity to look after her during the school holidays so we came to my mum s and i m working remotely she s beautiful friendly well spoken and a happy go lucky kid everyone loves her she s generally very well behaved too but sometimes when my mum is around she starts acting up because she knows she can get away with anything sometimes it can t always go her way and i take the ipad away to make her understand she was upset about it last night so i sat down to talk to her about it we both agreed we have to do better and i thought we were done but then she started crying her eyes out and told me she had been bullied in school by girls in her class and that she had no friends but again because she has a heart of gold and probably also afraid of repercussions she never wanted to tell the teacher it broke me because no kid deserves this but also because i didn t know how to handle it i explained to her that there will always be people who don t want to be our friends and that s fine but in no situation is she to just accept being bullied that s not ok my sister was about to turn when she had her so she is effectively a single mum now that my niece is older she told her about her dad i think it was a good call to wait until she was older so she could understand but my niece feel betrayed and doesn t understand why my sister hid it from her she also doesn t feel like a normal kid for being in a single parent family then she s also scared about her mum ending up alone because she s been in two relationships that didn t work out i had no idea of the burden this kid was carrying and i honestly don t know how to help her i talked to her tried to make sure she understands she s the most important thing in her mum s life and that everyone around her loves her unconditionally but at the same time no year old kid should even be thinking about this kind of stuff let alone be consumed by it on a daily basis i feel helpless,0,0.05,0.95,0.05,0.05

proud dad moment here yesterday while visiting out of town friends with older kids i had a heart melting moment that i thought i d share after some days of rain us parents were trying to get the older kids outside to burn off some energy after they had spent hours day on their ipads our friends have a yo girl and a yo boy ours is a yo boy i decided to make some challenges for the two older kids to get them exercising their house sits atop a hill with some gullies on either side so i thought some hill races would be perfect to burn energy one of the challenges was to have them run down the sidewalk around the driveway loop their driveway makes a teardrop loop like a cul de sac with a garden in the center then back to the house the driveway teardrop is on a hill the farthest side behind the garden is a steep hill and hidden from view by the garden the closer side is a shallower grade uphill this was a time trial race so the kids wouldn t get discouraged with each other the yo wanted to go first so we did the proper countdown and away he went seconds later he returned excited as could be next went the yo she took off like a shot from a canon racing down the sidewalk i briefly noticed my yo following her giggling as he trotted down the sidewalk as well the yo rocketed down the far side of the driveway and we could barely see her head as she took a wide turn at the bottom and charged back up the hill her mother and i were amazed at how fast she was moving that we didn t notice my yo at all she raced back up the sidewalk and crossed the line at an astonishing seconds when it was all over i turned to my wife and asked where s our yo to which she replied i think he s playing around the end of the house just then at that very moment my son emerged around the turn at the bottom of the hill the sun was high above and it illuminated his white blonde hair like a moviestar he had the biggest shit eating est grin on his face i d ever seen he was so happy to be running and playing the same game as the older kids that it completely melted my heart i started jumping up and down and cheering him on as he trudged back up the hill and down the sidewalk across the finish line where we all met him with cheers and high fives seconds a world record in the yo grouping more than half of his lifetime has been spent isolated from children and adults as this pandemic ran its course and i could not have been more proud to see him happy and trying in his best effort to play with the older kids,0,0.04,0.96,0.04,0.04
concerned about speech delay i ll preface this by saying that we ve scheduled an appointment with the pediatrician to discuss this beyond that i m keeping in mind the kids develop at different rates advice what the title says son is a little over years old months to be exact excels at gross motor skills friendly social size of vocab not a problem words the problem rarely ever never really uses pronouns i you me etc or verbs mostly speaks in single words occasionally adjectives usual color vehicle or something similar this might be combined with general concern about attention span he has never ever answered a question of mine with yes or no ever ever if he wants something he points and uses single word i have attempted so hard to get him from cookie to i want cookie but to no avail he could be dying for a cookie i could ask him a million times do you want a cookie and yet it is completely beyond him and yet he clearly understands what no means because he gets upset if he hears no cookie or something he also clearly understands instructions pick up that book and go upstairs and give to mama he ll do it and yet he has never uttered a yes or no in his life he can answer other questions where is the horse what color is this but never ever a yes or no so lots of nouns often nouns repeated enthusiastically bus bus bus bus often completely random like we re sitting eating dinner and he says escalator escalator used to find it cute now i m just worried i just see other kids his age more engaged parents ask if they want something and they say yea or no they say look a bus daddy he just says bus the lack of engagement bothers me most how could it be so beyond him to say yes or i want a cookie even if i m instructing him to do so and he is dying for a cookie is this normal sincerely a dad who is clearly too worked up about this,0,0.06,0.94,0.06,0.06

unpopular opinion six of crows is vastly overrated spoilers i know this review is a few years late but i have opinions and nowhere else to share them so here i am in high school i lost interest in reading i think my english classes sucked the joy out of reading for me and my adhd made it difficult for me to start and continue reading books this was sad to me because i like stories and i love writing so i wanted to get back into it i heard that six of crows was one of the best ya books ever that it was mature and diverse and had interesting characters so i was very excited to start reading it when i first started it i couldn t get past the first two chapters again i think this is something i can attribute to my adhd but freshman year of college i picked it back up and actually managed to make it to the last few chapters before putting it down and never picking it up again needless to say i was majorly let down by this book people kept raving about how good it was for a ya novel booktubers praised it like it was the next bible and i could only find a handful of negative reviews but i couldn t and still can t see why people have such raging boners for six of crows first of all the characters were unbelievable and stale which is sad because many people say the characters are the best part of soc all of them are teenagers teenagers i know it s ya but yeesh they ve all some how managed to acquire lifetimes worth of trauma then become feared respected criminals in a world full of actual adults this is bullshit one of the characters becomes an uber talented gold medal level gymnast universally feared assassin in the span of a year which is completely absurd given the fact that she s like it would still be absurd if she was older the main character is just as bad you can t become al capone at you just can t i don t care how much your trauma has hardened you becoming a criminal master mind takes time and experience besides the unrealisticness of these characters a lot of them are just boring kaz is a mary sue jesper is the forced comic relief who isn t that funny the nerdy twink who s so forgettable his name escapes me is super boring and the other two are for the most part there for their questionable romance inej was the only one i kinda liked but again she was a seasoned assasin at so i found it hard to take her very seriously also she unironically refers to herself as the wraith which is stupid and these characters aren t complex or deep and i don t think any of them experienced much growth throughout the story the author decided to see how much over the top trauma she could jam pack into the characters she cared about before throwing in the towel for the others and saying uh this guy likes gambling and guns lol it also irks me when people try to say the characters are trope diversions we must be living on different planets because i swear that male lead emotionally repressed because of his dark past and female lead who s character stems from sexual abuse who will ultimately break past male lead s shell are fairly common and soc didn t really do anything to subvert those tropes either also petka rollins is one of the worst antagonists in any book i ve ever read he has no presence he never feels like a threat and the fucking volturi from twilight are better bad guys then him and twilight sucks dude second of all the pacing was awful depending on who you talk to six of crows is a fast paced nail biter a slow paced piece that gets you thinking or a slow burn that grows into a fast paced heist this should not be the case also why oh why would she put flashbacks in the middle of action fighting scenes especially flashbacks that are super slow and long this can work in film but it can t in books where each word is carefully selected to create a tone and pace for what s happening on the page once your taken out of a fight scene you can t be thrown back in and expected to feel the same tension as before just put the flashbacks during the long tedious section on the boat or anywhere else besides a goddamn action sequence imagine if tolkien had put a twelve page flashback to pippin s childhood in the middle of the battle for helms deep or if jk rowling had put an arbitrary memory from the sorcerers stone as the golden trio escaped gringotts in the deathly hallows it would destroy these pivotal tension filled moments as well as the pacing thirdly the plot people have compared six of crows to oceans jesus christ the plot could have been interesting but in the end it was subpar the only part of the entire heist i found gripping was the part where inej climbed the incineration shaft but everything else was meh the premise of the plot is ridiculous no one in their right minds would hire a group of teenagers to do something this important every jam had a very convenient solution that they always managed to get right or that kaz mary sued his way out of because it s kaz also they consistenly make dumb ass choices like dumbass bitches they re trying to be stealthy and quick to sneak by the enemies let s have nina and matthias stop the entire group so they can have a shouting match and have no one interrupt to stop them the entire group is relying on kaz who s been portrayed as a competent leader up to this point to do this very important part of the heist in which his love interest could be killed let s have him run off on his own and be a dumb ass bitch if the story had spent less time on the boat and inej s booboo and more on the heist it might have been better but what s written is written fourthly the romances are all snoozefests or troubling usually ya spends too much time developing the romance this time it s the opposite the romance with the most screentime nina and matthias was my least favorite a lot of the times i think people try too hard to label the male in the romance as abusive or toxic but dear god did i want this girl to run it was like the fantasy version of a nazi jew romance at one point he literally compared her to an animal he tries to strangle her they insult each other s cultures all the time and i m supposed to be rooting for them don t forget the shouting match during the heist either inej and kaz needed more development than they got normally i don t like my books to be oversaturated with romance but these two really needed some more scenes together to convince me of their relationship lastly if you can even count it as a romance jesper and twinky people praise this book for being lgbt inclusive but that s just insulting these two despite having the cutest healthiest dynamic were pushed to the back the relationship was nothing more than cheeky flirting and there wasn t a single explicitly romantic scene before i set down the book a few chapters from the end unlike the other couples hell half of the time i was left wondering if they were actually supposed to be a thing or not because of how little content there was for them in conclusion none of the romances were convincing or anything i wanted to root for last but not least the platonic relationships are super weak i get the feeling i m supposed to feel like these guys are found family by the end of everything but i don t even jesper and kaz who are supposed to be bffs have no chemistry or moments where i truly feel like they re good friends the dialogue between all the characters tries too hard to be witty sassy or badass it feels like everyone talks as if they re the discount guardians of the galaxy there are no moments where the entire crew kinda chills and get closer by opening up to everyone not in a way that i can recall by the end i don t feel like i m reading about a group of kids who would die for each other or want to go on to have another book of adventures together this is sort of a side note but what s with all the k s just call it coffee instead of koffee or fabrication instead of fabrikation they still spell coffee with a c in amsterdam which is clearly where the city is based off of why do fantasy writers always feel like need to spell things weird like if they change one letter for another it automatically makes their world dyfferenter or kooler don t change words unless there s a legitimate reason which there almost never is also the world building is really confusing if you haven t read her previous books and she doesn t explain it that well in conclusion i think soc has fooled everyone into thinking it s not full of cliche tropes and characters by american idoling it what do i mean by that well you know on talent shows when someone might be an average singer but they have a massive sob story so everyone wants to believe they re better than they actually are that s how i feel soc was written the plot is mediocre and the pacing is all over the place the relationships romantic and platonic are either toxic or underdeveloped it s a book no darker or mature than the hunger games a novel about children being forced to murder each other for the entertainment of society but has somehow tricked everyone into thinking it is it s the girl who dresses in all black gets one nose piercing and then thinks she s the edgiest person in the entire school or as daniel greene put is so perfectly adam levine if you actually took the time to read this far thank you i ve been wanting to write a post like this for awhile but today i said fuck it and went ahead do you agree or disagree let s have a civil discussion in the comments,1,0.92,0.08,0.92,0.07999999999999996

i just finished fear and loathing in las vegas and i m pretty confused hoping to get some context or explanation on the recommendation of my friend i read fear and loathing in las vegas by hunter s thompson i read the book with absolutely no context other than that it is supposedly autobiographical and i really have no idea what to make of what i just read i have several questions and would love to hear the thoughts of those who read it firstly i am confused about the way that the book was written it seems that our two protagonists hunter s thompson and his attorney who apparently was actually oscar zeta acosta went on this trip with a tape recorder constantly recording them and that dialogue was later morphed into the book my first question is when was the actual book written relative to when this trip happened it sounds as if it were written by someone currently in a deep drug induced psychosis for example in the th chapter of part thompson writes that he is to meet a man from whom he arranged to buy an ape a situation that isn t prefaced at any other point in the novel it s obviously a fictitious event or some sort of hallucination there s also an entire chapter of the book that contains only dialogue transcribed directly from the tape prefaced by the following editor s note gt at this point in the chronology dr duke appears to have broken down completely the original manuscript is so splintered that we were forced to seek out the original tape recording and transcribe it verbatim we made no attempt to edit this section and dr duke refused even to read it was the novel based on notes that thompson took during the trip and written afterward based on this note it seems that a very loose and confusing transcript was being cobbled together by editors who were on their own secondly i m confused about the line between fact and fiction in this story i understand that the novel is coming from the perspective of a man on a combination of hallucinogenic and dissociative drugs but the outline of the story is supposedly based on his real experience during the novel our protagonists commit a litany of felonies including but not limited to grand theft credit card fraud illegal firearm possession possession of an unbelievable amount of narcotics and sexual assault of maybe a minor surely these events are written about in the context of fiction otherwise these crimes could have been very easily traced back to the author right to what degree am i to believe that these events happened supposedly the mint race and the narcotics convention actually happened months apart some of the events in the last chapters are just completely nonsensical like the ape attacking the man at the casino bar or the attorney attacking a maid and then recruiting her to be a police informant to silence her are these all just recollections of drug induced hallucinations is that the point of the narrative that the reader has no idea what actually happened and what was hallucinated or imagined by the author to what degree did hunter s thompson address the events of the book afterward fictional or otherwise i finished the book shortly before writing this post and i m hoping for any sort of context that might help me understand what i just read i would also just like to know what other readers made of this one it s actually the first book i ve read in its entirety since middle school i m i m certainly going to have to re read this one,1,0.93,0.07,0.93,0.06999999999999995

the midnight library this book leaves me positive and with potential right from the first page it has been gripping a tinge of mystery hope and just pure joy sometimes you wonder how a can a book speak to you at soo many different levels and understand you this is maybe that kind of book for me and many other people it revolves mostly around something we all encounter which is regret the author and the characters speak and appeal to the deepest insecurity that one has which is about the decisions one has taken i was left vulnerable as if i were talking to a friend a close one someone who had known you for a long time someone who wanted to help like a well wisher if the author matt haig ever reads this post i would personally like to thank him for his contribution to the world i am sure that in times of uncertainty when you seem to be loosing touch with life this happens when you stop noticing the small tiny things which bring you pleasure but during those times what you need to do is to sit back and read the midnight library it will give you strength a positive outlook and leave you with tears of joy as you encounter yourself midst the characters and their lives it has been sometime that i ve read such a feel good book and then was left feeling empty after i completed it last night it was a beautiful journey i am looking into other books by the author if you have any suggestions for me to check out i would love to take a look at those any similar feeling books i would also love to know what you ll have felt and understood after reading this beautiful gem of a book every reply is appreciated,1,0.96,0.04,0.96,0.040000000000000036

how do you build strong children teach them to ask why often teach them to listen and empathise by listening and empathising with them teach them to care for others who are more vulnerable it takes less effort to be kind than be a dick so teach them that teach them to identify and name their own emotions as well as identify why they ve felt certain feelings why they got angry or sad or happy children don t know that automatically they just know they feel big big feelings teach them to identify when they are getting angry or sad for how look at the traffic light regulation system teach them to talk about their feelings or if they find words hard or are too young for words give them other outlets teach them it is okay to lose it s okay not to be the best at the thing they can try their hardest and that is also okay but if they don t make it they just didn t make it and that s fine teach them good health habits early they don t have to be a hyperfit sports kid winning trophies just get them into running and moving around and appreciating the relief that comes from a good stretch of wearing yourself out i hate exercise but when my emotions run high physical exertion can make me feel so much better i don t go working out in some gym i just go run around or skate or goof off teach them the only thing they are entitled to are human rights and kindness they are not entitled to certain jobs they are not entitled to social status they are certainly not entitled to anyone elses personal time teach then love is love and you don t have to agree with everything to be at peace that it s in the world teach them live and let live teach them their opinion their view their beliefs they have value relevance and they matter but they are not the only view belief or opinion that matters teach them they are only the main character in their own story in everyone elses they re a background character,0,0.47,0.53,0.47,0.47
my son months got bitten at the daycare today so i picked up my son from the daycare and his teacher informed me that he was bitten by another child it appears that this kid expresses his anger frustration which seemingly occured over a toy fortunately the wound is not deep nor open and the bite marks are minimal however the idea that my son was hurt because of another and cried excessively because of this crushed my heart to pieces the thought that he suddenly experienced such a pain and had to deal with it without me or his mother being present really hit me that being said are there any measures we can take against this or anything we need to discuss with the daycare in addition they told me that they are aware of the biting habits of this kid but couldn t react in time because of how hectic it was is it fair to make a point of this or is this another one of those things that s unfortunately a possible risk at the daycare,0,0.08,0.92,0.08,0.08
should we back out of our friend s wedding due to covid concerns i have an month old daughter the absolute love of my life my pregnancy took up most of our covid lockdown last year she has still met very few friends and family members due to our concerns and my husband and i always prioritize her health and safety we ve been extremely careful throughout the pandemic our friends are getting married at the end of september and both my husband and i are in the wedding party planning to be at the wedding all day away from our daughter has been stressful enough but now with covid cases surging and new information about vaccinated folks being able to transmit the new variants i m going back into super cautious mom mode i don t even want to leave the house at this point because i m so terrified of my daughter getting sick the couple does not seem to be showing any indications of postponing the event so far our state the wedding venue also don t have any changes to capacity limits mask mandates etc so it look like this big shindig is happening in a month and a half regardless of how irresponsible it may be my mom instincts are telling me that the responsible parenting choice is for my husband and i to pull out of the wedding and prioritize our daughter s safety but i m not sure if i just have blinders on and am not thinking rationally any advice would be greatly appreciated,0,0.05,0.95,0.05,0.05

how to deal with my own illness as a parent if i don t have a social net i have health repercussions from an auto immune disease that damaged my immune system the result is that i can get very sick from a minor cold or flu going around to the point that a few times per year my husband will have to take a day or two off to stay home and take care of me because it gets so bad that i can t get up and prep my own food etc really really sick you get it a little bit before getting pregnant my partner m and i f moved to a new state for work we both work full time i was concerned about how to handle my constant illness once i would have a baby when my husband is here he takes care of kiddo but a few times per year he goes on a trip to see some friends i do the same and i m worried about getting sick during one of those times also when i get sick and kiddo is sick that means he can t go to daycare often i am able to function when i m sick and i push through and take care of my kiddo other times it s not physically possible fever of debilitating headaches etc someone reassured me if you don t have family to help you you can buy family just pay someone to help you when needed money can take care of everything this gave me a lot of peace of mind and probably caused my warped sense that everything would be manageable we have some small friend groups in a few states none nearby and but no real home base we don t have good relationships with our families and don t have anyone outside of ourselves to reply on when major issues happen but that reassurance was enough to make me feel like we could handle it since we re fortunate enough to make enough money for things like that when needed low and behold after having the baby i got sick baby was fine but i wasn t well enough to take care of her i tried finding someone to pay to help but no one wanted to work with a kid with a sick family member of course and i don t blame them this left me stuck so in my ill and desperate state i posted to a local moms group asking for what type of role or business i should be looking for as to who i can pay to help i got a whole lot of uhh moms don t get sick days posts this infuriated me for two reasons i get that people need to push through it if they re sick but when you are too sick to safely stand up how is it okay to take care of a vulnerable human being that doesn t seem safe for the parent or the child would they tell a cancer patient that if so fuck them if not fuck them for assuming that i m just being prissy so this post is a big vent session obviously a reminder not to tell people to suck it up when they re sick and reaching out for help you don t know their medical situation and it just isn t helpful frankly a plea for help does a person exist who will either come take care of kiddo when the kiddo is sick and or when a family member is sick i would be fine with paying hazard pay and having them wearing a mask the whole time my toddler is fine with this too he s used to masks even having then play outside for the majority of the time weather allowing someone suggested looking into respite care but it seems to only be for the elderly or for kids with non communicable health issues thank you for reading please see or let me know if you ve experienced anything like this it makes me think that people in my situation no family support just shouldn t have been bold enough to have a kid we certainly aren t having a second because of this one issue and it breaks my fucking heart,0,0.08,0.92,0.08,0.08
ready player amp who is the intended audience vague spoilers below i won t go into anything major but beware i recently read ready player and and can t figure out who the books intended audience is the obvious option nerds that love video games and have loved then since the s except the book goes to great lengths to describe basic features of video games including what a score board is and how the game pacman works the books are written for nerds gamers but add extra details so that kids and less enthusiastic readers can still follow the story the issue with this one is that the books consistently go into great depths about s pop culture the books talk about the planet weapons items and planets without describing them they only name them they describe outfits from s movies again only using terms such as the blue dress from movie they also spend a large part of the second book in both a prince themed that wouldn t make a lot of sense if you weren t at least vaguely familiar with prince the author wrote a story that they enjoyed and wanted to share it with the world if this were the case then why would there be entire chapters dedicated to describing what a killscreen is or how a particular arcade game plays out going to such great lengths to share details shows that the author understands that now every reader has their exact understanding of s pop culture the author assumes that the reader has a vague understanding of both videogames and s pop culture and assumes they can use the context of the book to fill in what they are missing we then come back to the issue of describing how basic things like scoreboards work while also adding the issue of entire worlds that focus around understanding details of price s life or clues to riddles being found in schoolhouse rock songs,1,0.89,0.11,0.89,0.10999999999999999

book collection dilemma so even if this is a small problem i have been obsessing over it for the past couple of days and i get so frustrated i want to start to expand my book collection but the problems is both paperbacks and hardcovers are bad in their own way or atleast i see it this way while paperbacks might be cheaper i hate when the book spine gets creases while you re reading at the same time i hate being extra careful and opening the book only like centimetres to avoid the book spine creasing while reading it is not comfortable hardcovers are the better choice for me but they are not perfect either most often they come with these annoying dust jackets with hardcovers i hate leaving the dust jacket on while reading as it slips away all the time but i also hate removing the dust jacket every single time i am reading that very book i would throw the whole dust jacket away but the book covers underneath dust jackets are very often just plain and very ugly the best thing would be to buy every book as a hardcover but with the cover directly printed onto the book itself no dust jackets this way i can keep the original design of the bookcover i like this as it personalizes the book however this is a very rare option in bookshops or online also many books i would like to have in my personal library aren t available as hardcovers only as paperbacks i have watched a few tutorials on youtube now on how to convert paperbacks into hardcovers while keeping the original covers however this is not a perfect solution as i am afraid i might damage a perfectly good book and maybe it won t even look well afterwards i thought about maybe having my paperbacks profesionally converted but this also costs some amout of money i was wondering if anyone has the same perfectionist problem and has found a solid solution i would be very thankful if somebody helped me out,1,0.93,0.07,0.93,0.06999999999999995

my child won t talk my second child is almost two i know it is a bit early to be freaking out that he won t talk he has words uh oh and ta da obviously a huge fan of hyphens the problem seems to be that he is just too smart to talk like he is really easy to understand through his pointing head nods and shakes and grunts he doesn t see a need to talk he understands pretty much everything we say to him and we just talk to him normally neither my wife nor i talk to our kids like they are babies we have him seeing remotely a slp but i am skeptical of how much he actually needs that do we just wait it out,0,0.08,0.92,0.08,0.08

something i ve slowly become aware of as i look at the earlier works and lives of some of my favorite authors is that they also had their own inspirational authors not completely unexpected but my real surprises been how sympatico i find the writing i can t recall where exactly but at some point i discovered that hp lovecraft s favorite author was algernon blackwood reading his stories easier since they re mostly all available at project gutenberg was like i d been swimming in a pool my entire life and then jumped off a dock into a deep lake it was a unique vividness i hadn t experienced i ve only just recently learned about the works of the roman poet ovid p blius ovidius n s who was reportedly william shakespeare s favorite author despite their lives being separated by centuries i find his poetry incredibly captivating this from a person who only occasionally reads robert frost and little else poetry related i d be curious if anyone else has had a similar journey with their their own reading,1,0.94,0.06,0.94,0.06000000000000005

asking for advice y o female removed possessions and most furnishings from bedroom this is my first time posting to this sub i ve provided a quick background and then a scenario with a request for any advice from those that may have experienced something similar please note i struggled with the verbiage and wording to use i m not sure if i m overthinking it or not but trying to paint a picture of the scenario with words isn t my strong suit so please ask questions to clarify if you re interested background i m a year old female that happens to have a year old sister when she was born we had an instant connection and while i ve moved to different cities and states for my career throughout her childhood we have always been incredibly close my sister lives in the same house as my mother who is the primary caregiver and rarely sees or has contact with her father scenario about a year ago when i was visiting my mother and sister i went to the nd floor of the home where my sisters bedroom is located and i noticed that my sister had taken all of the decorations in her bedroom even her bedside table nightstand and lamp and put them in a different unused room in the house her bedroom furniture decore now consisted of her bed a computer and a tv with a tv stand it was unlike any bedroom of a year old girl i d ever heard of or seen the discarded items lay in random piles all over the unused room and when i went back to visit a few weeks after i noticed this all of her belongings were still in the unused room and her bedroom was still bare bones everything from her hand drawn doodles to jewelry that we had gotten together headphones and posters etc all just lay haphazardly a year later same story note due to a physical limitation it was very difficult at the time for my mother to climb the stairs and therefore she rarely ventured to the nd floor and she was unaware of the situation i asked my sister why she didn t want her lamp and nightstand in her room just seemed like they would be helpful to have at the very least she shrugged it off saying that she didn t like anything in her room at all i asked her about the jewelry and other items headphones paints and markers books photos of friends amp family notepads all things that a year old girl has in her room etc and she said she didn t want any of that stuff and that i could put it in a yard sale the only frame of reference i have for any of this is thinking back to when i was her age years ago my room was my oasis my home inside my house i kept my things albeit a bit messy in my haven and found comfort in my bedroom seeing as i have no experience in this realm i wanted to reach out to see if anyone has experienced this with their children or siblings and if so i d love any feedback thanks in advance for reading and my apologies for the long winded post,0,0.24,0.76,0.24,0.24

six year old potty issues i don t know if this is the right place to post it but i m desperate for some kind of advice or experiences my now six year old daughter was a tough one to potty train my husband and i not her bio father got her on track her bio father wasn t present during this time for about a year and then was she was about or when she started having visits with her father again she regressed with using the potty in regards to pooping when she began seeing him again we got her somewhat back on track but i ended up taking her to the doctor because she kept having poop accidents she got an x ray and the doctor said she was severely constipated and her theory was that she was holding it until she got constipated and then was afraid to go because it hurt so we got her cleared out and after a while got her bowel movements to be regular we haven t had issues at our house in a long while but when her dad drops her off he often about every other week says she had an accident yesterday he dropped her off and said she had an accident at his house and then she proceeded to have multiple accidents here until she got it all cleared out i have no interest in trying to blame him for something that isn t his fault but it s hard not to think that this is due to something going on at his house i know from multiple things that she tells me that she spends the majority of her time at her dads sitting in his room watching youtube on a tablet she says she doesn t know where her dad is when she s doing this she s six and can be dramatic so i try to take what she says with a grain of salt but it has been consistent that she says things about it i don t know what to do at this point she s six and she knows that she shouldn t be having accidents it hurts her self esteem even though i try to be gentle about it i also am concerned about her having long lasting issues because of this i don t know if i should say something to him about not just leaving her in front of a screen all day sometimes she requires a reminder to try to poop and i feel like that s not happening i don t know what s going on but she doesn t have any dietary issues i m going to call her doctor and make an appointment but i m just afraid any time she goes back over there all progress will be undone again if anyone has any advice on how to handle this i would very much appreciate it,0,0.07,0.93,0.07,0.07

great expectations ending i m very late to the club i know this post has been made before but i ve just finished great expectations it being my first dickens novel and liked it a lot i love dickens writing style the loooong flowy sentences and characterisations of all his characters especially estella you could feel how cold she was through the pages and havisham down to the minute details of her rotting wedding dress the moldy cake the clocks stuck minutes to pip was the most unlikeable main character i ve had to sit through reading maybe because i couldn t help but perceive this book through my modern lens but i was so pleasantly surprised by how funny volume was joe s little monologues made me tear up a bit i found it hilarious how joe and biddy got married in the end just paragraphs after pip was planning on proposing to biddy it was the perfect touch and how most of the mysteries alluded to throughout the book were solved by the end except for why mrs joe was so nice and smiley to orlick who confessed to having caused her illness that i don t get well but that happy ending with estella bummed me out a bit i read that dickens friend made him rewrite a happy ending but i think the ending of estella staying married and unavailable and pip living and dying a dissatisfied or maybe finally satisfied with a simple life bachelor would have been a lot more fitting with the overall tone of the story anyways i m sure this has book has been discussed at great lengths many many many times before just wanted to give my thoughts since i have no friends who ve read this lol,1,0.99,0.01,0.99,0.010000000000000009

year old without boundaries i know someone who has a sister with a kid who is years old and they both live with the sisters mom and dad and had for pretty much all of years of the sisters life except the one year she moved out got prego and eventually moved back home she smokes drinks parties and has taken the kid with her on every partying adventure she goes on including the one that got him removed from her custody when she got stuck in some neighborhood in a ditch and was arrested for drinking and driving crazy enough they gave the kid back when she befriended the caseworker and was secretly advised on what to do and in no time back to her ways so the kid obviously has some major anger problems cause not sure how he could feel any other way considering the way he s being dragged all over and witnessed crazy stuff so he is constantly putting his hands on other kids fist fighting them doing crazy crap teachers are irritated and not only does he not get any kind of discipline but if when he gets in trouble for fighting at school he just says whatever and his mom does nothing so whenever he gets in trouble he simply says someone put their hands on him so she goes as far as calling in on a teacher and saying how the teacher is hating on her son and put his hands on the kid when he tells her his side he has four male cousins same ages and every time is together with them and his mom is with him he ll straight up take his fist at wherever it lands and he s always making another kid cry so my friends mom came over and of course she s always having to watch him since he lives there and of course he was with her the other day my friend suggested him staying seeing how good he was being next day he was eating lunch at the counter when my friend went to the garage and all of a sudden heard her son screaming in agony out comes her year old son saying the kid beat him up so my friend went inside and asked what happened and he was sitting there calmly eating as if nothing happened she asked him why he did that and calmly said he hit me while continuing to eat the food in front of him she explained to him that she would watch the camera to see what happened after listening to both sides and of course she saw her nephew get really ticked off when her kid was going up to him with a pool noodle and he told him to get away from him while he was eating and looked around the corner to see if his aunt was around and violently went off on her son so privately she talked to her son about not provoking people and calmly talked to her nephew who sat there and acted as though he did nothing wrong at all every time she has the kid in her house he ends up taking his fist to her son so she doesn t have him over but maybe twice a year this time without his mom present she felt she could only talk to him about fighting morals ethics golden rule and how he d feel and did so in a different way than he was use to but she wasn t getting thru not even a little bit i get why she doesn t want to go over to her moms she has even made a point not to attend holidays but still has been surprised with pop up visits from her sister or the mom who of course always has this kid so she talked to him until she felt she wasn t getting thru and her sisters lack of parenting had major messed this kid up she immediately took him home and her mom just said they should had picked him up earlier she knew he d go in and tell his mom the same thing he always did and nothing would happen she was so mad at herself for even inviting him to stay but she hoped that by having him maybe he would have fun being a kid and he actually did for a short time when the boys played in the sprinkler and had some kid fun the kid has always asked her to come over to stay but she always said no i ve seen the kid act out in rage when he thought no one was looking at a halloween party last year we went upstairs to a locked room and went out of a window on the roof acting like a fool and my friend saw him when she was talking to someone in the front yard she about had a heart attack just from this and then after everyone was gone the whole window fell inside and glass was all over their room because when he had put it up it was a window they never opened cause it had needed replaced since they moved in and eventually turned into as soon as they got enough money and time off work to replace it themself a month later cold month in november too did her sister care nope his mom had just said one of the other kids had done the exact same thing so it wasn t just her son so no matter what this kid does she makes excuses unless she s with one of her crazy partying friends who doesn t let kids take control then you ll hear her yell at him so they don t lecture her it s sad when you see a kid look at you with dark beady eyes and full of rage and the whole time my friend was trying to teach him about putting his hands on people he was just sitting there after he was finished with his lunch not looking at her and when he finished just staring back at her not saying a word and it felt like a kid from a horror movie about to attack she immediately took him home and dropped him off to her mom but she s irritated her sister doesn t do a thing for any of his bad behaviors just rewards him with whatever he wants no matter the day of the week,0,0.09,0.91,0.09,0.09
need help for family counseling i need help i m at a point that i no longer know what to do this has been the toughest year of my life and there doesn t appear to be a light at the end of the tunnel this was the year that we had to come head to head with my son with anger issues that result in violent outbursts the outbursts can include hitting kicking biting scratching throwing items grabbing objects and hitting with them basically whatever he can to inflict pain on whoever he is mad at we ve been seeing a child psychiatrist for months and have made little traction i believe at this point that we need to also be seeing a family therapist to help give his mother and i additional parenting tools to deal with a son who is wonderfully intelligent but prone to acts of violence seemingly at random is there anything that could help me find help for my son and my family that i haven t thought of sometimes i don t even know what to look for the child psychiatrist we have seems like they might be in over their head the child play therapist we had did not find much because he is very well behaved around strangers especially those that play with him and give him attention please we need help these outbursts are tearing my family apart,0,0.22,0.78,0.22,0.22
unpopular opinion you don t read audiobooks there is a fundamental difference in being an active participant or passive participant of an activity when you read text on a screen or on a page it is an active activity you are the agent of which the story progresses and the direction and pace of the story depends on whether you are actively reading the words meanwhile for audiobooks it is similar to watching tv or listening to the radio you are the passive participant rather than reading and experiencing the text yourself you are hearing it second hand you are not the agent it s very easy to think about other things or zone out and all of a sudden five minutes have passed in the audiobook imagine trying to listen to fyodor dostoevsky michel foucault or any dense piece of literary fiction as a result of being the passive participant there will be many subtle details allegories metaphors and symbols that you might miss you won t be able to grasp the true meaning and analysis of a text,1,0.9,0.1,0.9,0.09999999999999998

yesterday a stranger wanted to give advice because our baby was crying anyone else yesterday our month old was feeling a little unwell we don t know exactly what was wrong exactly but we assume it s digestive issues which is causing our little guy to squirm and cry sometimes he feels better after passing gas or after he finished his duty into his nappy sometime that can take a while to happen anyway there is almost nothing you can do about comforting him except maybe put him in his cot or distracting him with some rattling toys that day we were out downtown because my wife wanted to buy something specific my boy was feeling okay before we departed so we thought we d be fine on the way there and when we arrived it looked differently though but we took our chance since he often sleeps in the car seat on the stroller but he would just not stop crying taking him out of the seat did nothing he would just continue crying no matter what we did so we decide to go back to the car and depart home again because it was just too much for the little guy and on the way back a stranger at the traffic light was already looking at us came over and said don t you want to put him in your arms it tears my heart hearing him scream like this i was already stressed out because of this whole ordeal but that really brought me to a boil like suuure why didn t we think of that before just pick him up and all problems are gone who knew what a saviour just to be clear we know about our son s issues and how he ticks we prepared ourselves for our baby in every way we could the light turned green and we rushed over saying it s none of his business he did not respond after that i knew this would happen some day but jeez i didn t know it would happen this early i really hope the next time it happens i can ask the next person if they have kids and if not shut the f up did anyone have a similar experience what did they say and how did you handle the situation,0,0.12,0.88,0.12,0.12

partner m doesn t let me f have a say in the way parent we parent our child mom my partner is an absolute amazing father to our child but lately i ve been noticing that whenever i recommend trying something new or want to do something with my son it s a no or it becomes to the point where he is shaming me even for my way of wanting to do things if that makes sense it becomes more so when we visit my in laws we sleep over on the weekends since we re on maternity leave i have done so much research and feel credible in regards of parenting our child i ve also have worked with children before he has not and uses reddit mainly nothing against reddit but what works for other families may not work for ours plus it feels like he is more trusting of other parents then me on top of it i even feel like my partner and his mil get way more time with our son if i want to take my son out for example to go visit my family or take him on a walk i always get some sort of response along the lines of no i knew he would be a hands on parent but i didn t think it d be to this extent i feel very intuitively as well when it comes to my child and parenting i feel like my partner is a bit controlling and his mother likes to join in on it it feels like she s always got something to say they ve actually gotten into an argument about whether we should breast feed or use formula i wanted to exclusively breast feed but we ended up introducing formula and now it s mainly what we use granted i m ok now with the arrangement because i at least get to breast feed him which i basically just breast feed him at night and away from his family at night is where i really feel like i get the most time with my son and can bond with him because it s my shift i d like to have more time during the day i feel like i m missing out on so much in regards of him growing i love my partner and his family but i feel excluded from my own son and i am his mother like i feel like this is so untraditional because you re always hearing about mother s not getting enough help etc i just want advice on how to set boundaries and express that i get a say in how our son is raised and not get ridiculed and have more time with him,0,0.03,0.97,0.03,0.03
just a small tip to understand babies and toddlers you have to understand that when we come into this world we are just some small animals taken from a universe and placed into another one if i would do that to you you would also cry scream and shit yourself for years you might think they know you but they don t they need to get used to you just like you need to get used to them so don t beat yourselves up when the little monsters just won t stop crying all you can do sometimes is to love them and be with them try to comfort them as much as you can but don t be too hard on yourselves when you can t and especially don t be hard on them they have no idea what s going on for the rest remember you won t sleep too much for years you have a partner if they stuck around that can help and you can be a team working on getting the best start in life for the little miracle you are awesome parents no matter how much or how hard your baby toddler cries,0,0.22,0.78,0.22,0.22
insecurity and anxiety in a year old allright so i really need some advice on this topic currently we are having the summer holiday and me m and my wife f have my daughter over for weeks she is f and we do co parent with her mom f and her husband m a short but to the point description of how this situation came to be our daughter was unexpected but very welcome we were very young and became more friends than lovers and decided to part ways before our daughter got old enough to notice the contact has always been friendly no issues back to the question as of the last few years we more and more notice that our daughter she from now on is really self aware and pretty insecure she is very smart her school grades are through the roof and also quite social also noticed reaffirmed by school but when getting into situations where own initiative is required she completely stiffens also we notice she panics very heavily in situations where kids sometimes end up in let me give you examples the first one she was paddling a rubberboat for the first time with a friend f i was on the side of the water watching after giving the basic instructions and helping them in the boat they took off i had my swimming pants ready just in case i did not really expect any trouble as when i was young i was paddling around in rubberboats at a younger age and my dad was often not even around just a few moments after taking off the rowing didnt really work out instead of listening to some helpful advice up the paddle over the water put it in again she started crying and panicking the boat drifted in the side of the water in the grass sorry english is not my native lang and they got stuck i fetched them out of the side and she didnt want to go in again and try again another example we took her to a small fair it was organized by locals and there was mainly some inflatable toys a bouncy castle a swimming pool a soccer cage and stands with candy and popcorn she was alone with the of us when asking her what do you want to do she just stands by your side unable to start interacting and having fun what you d expect is kids to get exited by walking into the fair and run towards for example the candy or pool or whatever she completely freezes out of course we try and help her in that situation but even going the m from where we were standing to the cotton candy stand was too much to ask for in the end we left last one short one the first few times we needed to come in order to ring the doorbell of the neighbour girl f to ask to play with her now she goes by herself i really need some advice on how to firstly deal with this and secondly help her it pains me a lot to see her unable to deal with common adversity and new undertakings and at this moment i feel not a good dad enough because i do not know how to help her out i feel this is the moment in her life she needs to get up and do more by herself little things like that example of ringing the doorbell any help and advice is appreciated,0,0.09,0.91,0.09,0.09

nine year old daughter sneaking sweets into her room not sure how to handle my nine year old daughter has some moderate weight issues she is on the higher end for bmi although not quite obese but enough that the doctor quietly said to me we should keep an eye on it if it goes higher generally as long as she is happy with herself and healthy i don t care if she is slim or not so long as she is not in territory that limits her physically or affects her health or energy or self image we try to have a balance of rules and flexibility with food we don t forbid our kids are allowed one small sweet a day we try to mainly get higher quality baked goods organic stuff good quality ice cream etc rather than candy we make healthy home cooked food but it can be hard to get the kids to eat it so they eat hot dogs or pizza more often than i would like but we try to keep it to slices of pizza one hot dog etc they have vegetables with every single meal and always have to finish all their veggies before taking more of whatever other thing we never have soda or juice in the house they can have one snack food a day but we keep the portions small younger one doesn t have much sweet tooth and is average weight yo is somewhat obsessed with food especially sweets baked goods pastries as i ve said we ve always tried to indulge her taste with moderation e g we can get the pastries from her favorite bakery but she only eats one modest sized one in spite of this i feel that we have somehow stressed her out or made her feel ashamed about food we don t ever mention her weight but i think it comes through when we see her doing certain things and worry about it e g see her putting a ton of dressing on her veggies or piling on fries from the fries basket i think there s something subtle in the way my wife and i react that must be sending the wrong message it s a feedback loop because the more her weight is impacted the more we start to worry or stress over it and the more likely we are to inadvertently react recently i discovered she had been hiding sweets in her desk drawer in spite of the fact that we allow her a sweet every day and have never forbidden her sweets i m not really sure what to do clearly there is an issue here that could become a bigger issue i want to find a way to tell her that i love her and that i m not angry at her but also convey that we have rules and limits in our house including not eating in our bedrooms and having moderation i feel like maybe it would help if i can take the guilt out of it obviously she is hiding this and must feel ashamed or guilty advice,0,0.11,0.89,0.11,0.11

reading advice i would give my younger self i started homeschooling when i was and being able to choose my own reading material plus having more free time meant that this is when i really started spending a lot of time reading for fun my approach to reading has changed a lot over the years i m now so i figured i d make a post of the reading advice i would give to my middle school self if i could as a tl dr version here s each piece of advice without any elaboration quality over quantity don t try to speed read stop reading books above your level don t multitask reread books cover to cover okay now here s the list with explanations quality over quantity you remember that girl who brags about how she reads or books a week and made fun of you for only reading around book per month first she s an obnoxious fuckhead don t listen to her but more importantly i m going to let you in on a little secret she reads shorter books than you if you wanted to read or books a week you could but you d get so much less from it then you do from taking your time with interesting books so stop setting goals for yourself like i m going to read pages per day because you don t absorb what you re reading when you race through it instead maybe set goals like i m going to read for hour per day and if in that one hour you read pages cool but it s just as good if you only read pages in fact it s awesome if a book makes you stop and think even if that thinking means it takes longer to finish the book because that s a sign the book is engaging and you re really absorbing it it s also okay to start a book and never finish it you can still benefit from books without reading every chapter especially with non fiction where it might just be that some sections don t interest you don t try to speed read this is related to the last point please i m begging you stop watching youtube videos and reading articles with titles like how to speed read how to read faster etc you aren t a very fast reader but you have fantastic reading comprehension and part of the reason you absorb what you read so well is because you take your time with it so stop trying to rush yourself all the strategies you re using to try speed reading are decreasing your comprehension and just make reading stressful stop reading books above your level it s super cool that you re passionate about science and it s super cool that you like to read about it however there s no point in reading material that you don t have the background knowledge to understand so how about this if you re reading a science book and you get to a concept or equation that just doesn t make any sense write it down then using either the internet or by asking a tutor figure out what background knowledge you need to understand it quantum theory by david bohm is aimed at advanced undergraduates and you re a so of course there are parts you don t get maybe try setting it down and in the mean time study second physics by brian clegg which has a lot of the same concepts explained in a more accessible way also you should start studying calculus a lot of the books you re reading are meant for people already familiar with calculus don t multitask don t try reading books while doing something else i know that those videos on how to read more books that you watch advise you to always have a book with you so you can get in a few minutes of reading while doing something that doesn t require your full attention but as i ve already said the quality of your reading time matters more than the quantity you read if you only have minutes to read that s not enough time to process what you re reading it s also hard to follow the story or understand the concepts when you keep stopping and starting mid paragraph cause you re getting cut off only read when you re able to give the book your full attention also stop reading while you re waiting for your bus you re never able to focus because you re distracted by trying to keep one eye out for your bus and one day you leave your copy of thinking fast and slow by daniel kahneman at the bus stop you re able to find it but it s still a hassle also stop trying to listen to audiobooks i know you could finish so many more books by listening to them while doing other things but you just can t process books listening to them audiobooks work really well for a lot of people and they re a great resource for those people but you re someone who can only process books if you can read with your eyes accept that and move on reread books cover to cover i know you don t see the value in reading a book you ve already read but there s really so much to gain from revisiting good books especially fiction a year or more after originally reading them the book might be the same but you ve changed it s fun to see the different ways you relate to the characters the different ways you understand the themes and just overall how your experience of the book is different now that you ve had time to grow plus you ll have a new perspective on it now that you know the ending you might pick up on an instance of foreshadowing you hadn t noticed some specific books you ve already read that i recommend you reread from cover to cover ender s game by orson scott card ender s shadow by orson scott card hatchet by gary paulson a girl named disaster by nancy farmer roll of thunder hear

trying to find an explanation for a strange word i encountered hi i am currently reading ship of magic by robin hobbs which is the first book of the liveship traders trilogy i came across a weird word that struck me as i was not able to fully comprehend it and as english is not my first language this word is written as follows slaves cum sailors for the context it refers to slaves which have been freed following the boarding of a slave ship and acting now as sailors while waiting to reach port i had my guesses that it meant slaves become sailors and it got changed to cum but i am really not sure and i do not know if it could be a common practice to link these words i tried googling it but for quite obvious reasons i got entirely different results and i do not recommend doing it thanks ps amazing book so far and i absolutely loved the farseer trilogy,1,0.98,0.02,0.98,0.020000000000000018

is the sahm parent responsible for the majority of parenting disciplining i ask because this is what my husband seems to think when he comes home from work or on the weekends he gets angry and frustrated at me when our kids and act up our son had a tantrum on saturday and i ended up being the one in trouble for it maybe if your mother tried to discipline you the past years this wouldn t be happening he angrily yelled at me and him then he made some gun pew pew noises and my husband said oh he probably learned that at the daycare him mom takes him to cause she can t stand raising him they only go to school for hours days a week this is now becoming a trend with any behavior they do he will sit and wait for me to handle it then gets frustrated and angry if i can t stop the unwanted behavior on my own it s like i m on a job site being observed and anything that goes wrong is my fault instead of jumping in to help with the kids he gets angry at me i think some of it is that he s resentful he didn t get to be the stay at home parent and talks about how much better off the kids would be if he was constantly brings up the past and how i should have kept my job instead i m currently in an online program that will get me back to work by the time my son is in st grade my husband says that s too late for me to have a chance raising them so i might as well give up he works hours a week gets off work by pm and always has weekends off it s not like i m a military mom or he s away on business trips so i don t understand how all parenting mishaps fall on me,0,0.04,0.96,0.04,0.04
whoa little dude chill my almost year old son comes from a split home i left his dad when he was months old for a number of reasons some had to do with his shortcomings as a parent and some had to do with his shortcomings as a husband almost immediately my son dropped to last on my ex s list of priorities this wasn t surprising for me and my son showed a few signs that this upset him but he was still really young i unexpectedly started dating someone a few months later and we moved in together and got pregnant rather quickly our families have blended well together our kids are all the same age and they adore each other our baby is going on and my son loves being a big brother he is also about to start school and he s learning a lot of other skills to be more self reliant right now his dad is supposed to have him every other weekend overnight and once a week in the evening but misses multiple days a month or cuts visits short my son can be very overwhelmingly sensitive but lately that sadness that he s had has turned to rage and i find myself facing the brunt of it he gets so mad so fast over tiny things he screams throws things says he will never be my son again and never talk to me again he hits me and he has started hitting himself after he calms down and i talk to him about his behavior he gets sad and says he thinks that he s a stupid boy i am at a loss i don t understand his rage fits my so and i do really well with calmly parenting them through issues and we have a lovely blended family unit with lots of supportive extended family on both sides i don t think anyone has ever told him that he s stupid also before and after these outbursts he is calm and happy and lovely people have compkimented me recently on how friendly well behaved articulate etc he is is this just normal kid tantrums or is this some sort of trauma,0,0.05,0.95,0.05,0.05
i m fed up of parenting it s currently week of the summer holidays and i am already fed up of my boy being constantly around me before having a kid i used to think i don t see how people can be so fed up of their kids surely it s nice to spend time with them in the holidays but bloody hell is it exhausting i have no time to myself other than work which doesn t really count as a break if my partner has the same day off as me we will try and do something as a family we both work shifts so it s rare we get a full day off together and if its just the odd morning or evening here and there he ll be off playing football or at the gym if i do get a chance to go out i don t have any friends that can just spontaneously go out and do something they either have kids too or the ones that don t don t really speak to me anymore i don t have any hobbies i can go out and do or any spare money to just go out shopping or something for an hour or so while my partner is home i m just stuck in the house all day watching bloody cbeebies it started because i was fed up of the whining and gave in to give myself an easy day and now i can t get out of the habit i m making an effort to take the boy out each day even if it s just to the park or to do a food shop but even then i get fed up of pushing the same bastard swing for half an hour straight and then get whined at when it s time to go home its the whining that s really pissing me off i ve snapped so much at the boy the last couple days it s made him cry which has made me upset and feel like i m a shit mum i ve been trying to explain that when he doesn t listen it makes mummy sad and that s why i get grumpy at him he says he doesn t want me to be sad but that doesn t seem to stop him ignoring everything i say unless there s a bribe involved i think i m right back where i was just before he started nursery on the verge of wondering if was time to go see the doc for some anti depressants or something but just getting a few hours a week to myself made so much of a difference just a chance for me to watch some telly read a book and have a bath without someone coming in because they need a shit i didn t realise how much i relied on that time i thought it would be another couple of weeks at least before i got fed up of the holidays i know he s only going to be young once and i shouldn t wish the time away but it doesn t stop it being difficult in the here and now i m envious of the people that can just go out and do what they want when they want without having to plan around childcare and there s just that niggle in the back of my head saying to just walk away from it all which i obviously won t do because i love my family and i have nowhere to go even if i did want to bugger off somewhere i m just utterly fed up with it all anyway sorry for the moan just wanted to have a bit of a rant before bed i m not really expecting any responses but if i do i ll reply in the morning,0,0.09,0.91,0.09,0.09

are the most important books in the literary canon more or less summed up in or so books this is a serious question when i think of the most influential important must read top tier books in literature or if i come across people talking about great novels it always seems to be boiled down to handful of books the catcher in the rye the picture of dorian grey moby dick etc i see very little deviation when it comes to the most important books conversation i almost never see a book on these lists that i haven t heard of unless it s very recent and i feel like i could essentially read everything that great literature has to offer within the realm of books i would certainly hope this isn t the case but what are your thoughts,1,0.96,0.04,0.96,0.040000000000000036

i started comparing book summary websites here s what i found heya everyone since we re all interested in great lessons from the best books out there i decided to do something to help out with that i ve compiled a list of book summary websites that cover our favorite books and listed the pros and cons of the websites that way everyone can find their cup of tea when it comes to summaries whether you read the book or not a summary can help you out in multiple ways to remember what you read to remind you about the most important sentences or ideas from the book to quickly go over the main points so you know what the book is about to intrigue to read the book this isn t a definitive list of book summary websites just a list that i found interesting if you want to add more to this list drop a comment down below in the same format as the post is name of the website pros of it cons of it and i ll include it in the post nat eliason pros best high level thoughts nat really does great when he explains the entire idea behind the book in a few simple sentences writing style is easy to read and follow has a personal grading system for books cons it s unstructured at times nat doesn t have a framework for doing book summaries which sometimes makes it a bit cluttered there s a lot of copying some of the book summaries are technically notes from the book some summaries are copied notes from the book in their entirety four minute books pros they have over book summaries it takes only minutes to read a summary they have categories for book summaries which makes it easy to find the one you re interested in cons the summary is never longer than words which leave a lot of the book ideas out of the summary their format isn t good for the best books out there since they have to cut out a lot to fit it in minutes they don t actually read the books they write summaries for they read the summaries on blinkist and then write summaries of summaries blinkist pros they have more than books in their library not aware of the other pros since you need to pay to access the platform might need some help with this input cons pay to play they have a monthly subscription to read listen to their summaries growthabit pros they have a detailed structure of every summary the quality of their summaries is bar none i read their summary of the laws of power and i can safely say it s the best one out there they provide actionable steps to books and have a book grading system cons they only have book summaries so far they only have book summary categories self help psychology business amp finance and marketing derek sivers pros great one sentence summary of the book has over summaries sivers has read all the books he talks about cons the summaries aren t real summaries but book notes he copies his book notes and makes a summary out of those hard to skim the content of the summary are copied notes from the book so it makes it hard to skim the page hard to follow since the notes are copied from the book it makes it hard to follow the train of thought of the author the notes are quite scattered and not connected so you can t get a sense of the book the ripening pros easy to skim short to read cons copied notes from the book only a small number of summaries graham mann pros he has categories of book summaries making it easy to find the book you want he has a part in the summary called related books where he links to other book summaries for related books he has a grading system for books cons the book summary is comprised of copied notes from the book there are no subheads so the summary is hard to skim and find what you re looking for aside from copied notes there isn t much more to be found in the summary alex j hughes pros he has over book summaries he read all of the books he writes summaries about he has images along with book summaries so the user interface looks much better and easier to use cons again the book summary is just a single thought describing the book and then copied notes it s hard to skim content since there are no subheads some notes fail to capture the essence of the book unearned wisdom pros his book summaries aren t just copied notes he writes summaries of the books he reads he grades the books he reads on a scale cons he has only book categories some of the summaries are scattered on multiple web pages which makes it hard to follow it s a bit unstructured and that makes it hard to follow also the interface isn t really user friendly well that s it for me when it comes to book summary websites i know there are a lot more so add up the ones that you find interesting that i haven t covered above again it would be really great if you could do that in the format of pros cons so we accumulate a massive list of book summary websites,1,0.99,0.01,0.99,0.010000000000000009

guide to reading a clockwork orange i m on the rd chapter and this book feels exhaustive to read because of all the slang words i try to rely on only context clues to figure out what each words means but there are many sentences where half of the words in them are made up and i m not a native english speaker so idk if that has anything to do with it when i read a book i try to be immersed in it and not look something up until i put down the book and usually i feel like there is some joy in not knowing a particular word or phrase while reading having to use context and ruminating on it a bit after reading however with this book i ended up having to look up most of the words while not reading which i feel like takes the fun out of not knowing a word or two when you re bombarded with new words so this book isn t interesting me very much right now and idk if i should give up on it on a tangent this use of words reminds me the brief wondrous life of oscar wao but in that book not as many foreign words were used in such rapid succession and there s a lot more context given in between to figure it out also helps that i along with the sizable american population has learned some spanish in school i guess,1,0.93,0.07,0.93,0.06999999999999995

question about the iliad amp aeneid how in the world does diomedes who wounds both ares and venus and outrages athena not one to let things go escape divine punishment howdy again good people of r books so i recently read for the very first time the aeneid and totally loved it i had always avoided it out of a dumb childhood loyalty to homer and the greeks i thought the aeneid would be plodding and full of roman civic minded drivel and dullness but it was magnificent now i am on to the iliad which i ve never read i m just in the introduction right now but it mentions that the great greek hero diomedes was able to wound both ares and venus it s also explained in the aeneid that during the trojan war diomedes stole the sacred statue of athena the palladium which supposedly was a talisman that helped keep troy safe so in a world where humans are punished outrageously and hideously for looking at things they shouldn t for cutting down trees they shouldn t for boasting when they shouldn t for just being really skilled but maybe not quite skilled enough at something then how in the heck did this guy who actually physically wounded olympians and desecrated a temple of athena get away with it why was he spared how is he settled somewhere happily in latium years after the trojan war trying to speak reason and clemency to the latins when they want war with aeneas et al how did he escape divine punishment and what has made him so reasonable in his old er age,1,0.74,0.26,0.74,0.26

how to have more patience with toddler s hi i have two girls y old and months old i am just wondering how do you keep your patience and sanity with toddlers i like spending time with them but at the end of the day i am so tired that i can t wait for them to fall asleep so that i can finally have some me time which is usually just uninterrupted time in bathroom and sleep i like montessori parenting style and i am totally against yelling at kids because they are just small human beings who deserve to be respected i would feel very bad if someone yelled at me or speaking to me with angry tone so i definitely do not want to do this to my kids but there is huge but in this nice parenting ideas more often then i would like to everyday at least once i lose my nerves and patience and yell at them at older one usually afterwards i always feel guilty because i don t want to behave like that practing mindfulness and trying to meditate at least min everyday helped me a little to have more patience but sometimes i think that you really need to be some kind of zen master so that you never lose patience with toddlers,0,0.06,0.94,0.06,0.06

what are some books you personally thought had bad endings for me i recently read lucy foley s the guest list it was marketed as a thriller mystery so i thought that it would be unraveling clues as the story continued but since it became clear by the halfway mark that we hadn t even discovered who had been murdered much less the circumstances surrounding it or any clues i figured that the book itself was going to tell us and i was right and i get that everything fit together nicely enough but i m a sucker for those hercule poirot monologues where some brilliant detective manages to fashion together a dozen clues that seem unrelated so disappointed on that front another one is i m thinking of ending things really the rest of it was such a lovely book the dialogue and the way the relationship was framed and the jarring tension throughout the scenes but incorporating all the characters together into a single thing and then having the janitor kill himself i was kind of confused i understood what the author was intending but i was dazed after reading that book like i wasn t sure what my opinions were on it anymore what are your picks,1,0.95,0.05,0.95,0.050000000000000044

legend david gemmel yeah yeah it s not exacty highbrow stuff and most of it is pretty standard sword and sorcery but can i just take a moment to talk about the last half of the book and why i feel it s important to talk to somebody about it so basically the first half of the book is your standard sword and board fantasy character epic it s good don t get me wrong but it s nothing outstanding especially within an already crowded genre but the latter half the latter half of the book is all about narrating a massive siege taking place and some of the language used to describe the sheer hopelessness of the whole situation is uh unsettling in a good way the entire vibe of the book basically took a nosedive again in a good way it s a reluctant revelry in absolute despair which makes those very few moments when the main character performs acts of valor all the brighter and impactful i think this may be my first book by david gemmel and uh that was a wild ride so then i look the book up on the internet and then i find out in the middle of writing it he was suffering from cancer and he had every intention of making this book the last book he ll ever write and i was like ooooohhhhhhh shiiiiitttttt that explains it anyway highly recommended best description of a siege in a fantasy setting,1,0.88,0.12,0.88,0.12

am i weird for reading books at the same time before you judge me here s why i like it in the past i used to read a book as fast as possible and when i was through looking back i barely remember what some of these books were about also i was having a hard time getting back into reading recently because every book i picked up felt like a daunting task to commit the hours it would take to finish it now i have classics in my room and what i do is i read a chapter of one take notes about it in my phone to retain the information and then move on to a chapter in another book a final argument i will make in support of this is that when i read the introductions to some of the classics they would talk about how some of these books were written serially with chapters being released in monthly periodicals in their time so to me at least i want to treat these books like a slow burn when it comes to tv for instance i can binge with the best of them but there have been series i ve given up on with a few seasons left to go because i burn out i don t want to burn out on reading and i treat them like i would a tv show that has an episode aka chapter released every few days per my book rotation just wanted to see if anyone thinks i m crazy,1,0.92,0.08,0.92,0.07999999999999996

spoilers my one problem with project hail mary last warning major spoilers for project hail mary as ryland awakens from his coma he experiences amnesia from the drug that stratt gave him he remembers parts of his journey giving us the flashback sections that provide a great narrative for the events leading to his isolation when he is looking at his dead crew mates at the beginning of the book he feels profound sadness for their loss stating that they must have been close later when he remembers their names there s some paragraphs describing their characteristics and his bond to them however the last flashback we get is when stratt is going to drug him and put him on the ship he goes into his coma and wakes up before he really ever interacts with his crew mates on the ship it s established from his memories that he trained martin and his backup dr shapiro but there really isn t much about his interactions with yao and olesya i blazed through this book in days absolutely loved it but thinking back was the profound sadness he felt for his crewmates really earned i was expecting more interactions with yao and olesya to sort of justify the grief he feels at the beginning of the book like i said i blasted through this book so it s possible i missed something what do you think is the sadness stemming from him just being alone or should we assume the crew all got close prior to ryland being forced on to the crew,1,0.64,0.36,0.64,0.36

what s going on with my child our year old has been a handful since the day he was born and while i know parenting is a huge struggle i can t help but feel like our struggle has been much greater than the parents of his friends we thought he was autistic when he was little even took him into an occupational therapist who said he s not autistic but he s definitely different the struggles from the time he was a baby he would never let us sit down if we held him he was always a picky eater and even at he will typically only eat solid colored foods he wasn t fully potty trained until still struggles to wipe himself at struggles to repeat back to you what you tell him and is probably years behind in social emotional development he requires everything in a particular order gets completely stuck on something if it s in the wrong place and has some bad behavioral issues yesterday he shot his mom in the eye with a nerf gun from point blank range because he wanted to see what would happen he frequently hit kicked or bit kids at kindergarten he has an absolute meltdown anytime he can t fix or build sometime to his exact needs or desires he cries and whines about everything he sorta plays with other kids but he s still always kinda checked out if he is overstimulated he acts up if he is under stimulated he acts up now the good he was multiplying numbers at age he has very very highly developed perfect pitch musical trait he could explain in detail using medical terms how the heart ears and other parts of the body worked at age even now he just came into my room and said he needed blocks to build a x x cube he can speak two languages his favorite things to do are to read books practice math or watch educational shows on how things work when you talk to him it s almost like talking to an adult he s incredibly thoughtful always making us gifts and surprises his kindergarten told us that he s the smartest kid they ve even seen but that he s also the furtherest behind kid in social emotional terms that they ve ever had in his age group they said they have to dedicate an entire teacher to him because of how high maintenance he is we ve gone to parenting classes read books dozens of teacher meetings and nothing seems to help we constantly take him to the park or new places read to him every night etc is he just a different kid is he autistic or ocd or adhd or what he starts st grade in a couple weeks and we are absolutely terrified,0,0.11,0.89,0.11,0.11

how does everyone has such radically different interpretations of i ve read several books that have spawned a wide range of ideas about its meaning and real world application but nothing comes close to orwell s criticism of totalitarianism in his book it seems that everybody has a dramatically different idea of what ideology or political movement today most accurately fits the description of ingsoc conveniently everyone seems to believe that orwell is criticizing their political opposites the word orwellian is thrown around so often that it s become meaningless how is it possible that a book can create such dramatically different views i get that people enjoy bashing their political rivals but i ve never seen a book be liked so many people who have dramatically different views amp x b p s i m not asking for which interpretation you feel is right i m not going to help start a flame war i just want to know how a book can create such dramatically different and mutually exclusive interpretations,1,0.89,0.11,0.89,0.10999999999999999

about the genius of postmodernism i would like to tell you about my most favorite author and specifically about eduard limonov don t let it bother you that he is russian personally i think he s a genius for me he stands higher than dostoevsky and oscar wilde they are somewhat similar eduard limonov knows what to write about he has a difficult fate he went from a poor emigrant to one of the most respected people in paris it is worth noting that he has been in prison and has written several books about it but unfortunately eduard limonov died last spring and i can safely say that the last great russian writer died and now i want to tell you why i love him he wrote in a very deep and complex genre of postmodernism limonov s books are very hard and painful to read when i opened the author s first book this is me eddie i was frankly shocked by what was happening in it i read it with horror to be honest i couldn t finish reading the book at the age of but three years later i took up limonov again and i was pleasantly surprised i began to treat the explicit scenes more calmly and behind these scenes there are deep thoughts about the search for oneself escapism and human destinies in general i have briefly described only one book but almost every book by limonov is a cultural shock and a huge contribution to russian literature i would say that reading the works of limonov was a mistake after his books i became more pessimistic the world began to lose its colors but if i could live my life again then i would definitely make this mistake again p s sorry fo my english,1,0.92,0.08,0.92,0.07999999999999996

edward cullen pisses me off i read the twilight series a few months back and i was just thinking about it yesterday when i realised that edward cullen s power is actually an invasion of everyone else s privacy first of all i understand how useful it is and how essential it is to ensure the safety of those around him however what i don t get is why at other times when nobody around him is posing a threat to anybody that he cares about does he use his power for example when he initially proves that he can read minds to bella he does so by reading the minds of those at the restaurant in the movie nobody there other than the waitress even looked twice at them yet he read their minds just to prove a point he also does this to people at their school like jessica and mike in the book despite knowing that all that could go on in their heads are harmless teenage thoughts there are several other examples of this happening throughout the series now most people would dismiss this argument by saying that edward didn t intend to harm or use this information against any of them let me run a hypothetical situation by you you and i are friends and i ask you to reveal a secret that you ve never shared with anyone to me you know that i would never do anything to harm you with that information intentionally or not now will you reveal it to me you may or you may not and that s the point you get to decide whether i find out about it or not regardless of the fact that my intentions are harmless i e the fact that i don t aim to hurt you in any way doesn t entitle me to the information this applies to all humans and vampires yet edward seems to have no qualms about reading others minds without their consent i feel that he should have decided to only use his power when he needs to and not when he wants to while trying to bella that he can read minds he should have told her that he would never read anybody s mind if he could help it but would read only one person s mind then to prove it to her i feel that this would have improved his character but again this is just what i think i don t mean to stir up any trouble i am just presenting my honest take on the subject some people will disagree with what i said and that s totally fine also i posted this on r yalit a few days back but am now putting it up here too,1,0.61,0.39,0.61,0.39

need advice on fil little back story never had issues with my in laws until we got pregnant and had our baby nothing but critiquing our parenting including calling us germaphobes because we made people wear masks and wash their hands around our newborn now our baby is a year old and we ve relaxed a bit on covid stuff since getting vaccinated however the disrespect continues mil seems to have come around and said although she doesn t agree with our rules she understand things have changed since we were kids and she will respect our rules that being said we now allow her to watch our baby on her own since we are confident she won t just do something like give our baby a whole hot dog bc her kids survived fil on the other hand has become increasingly vocal about our parenting to the point where we overheard him on the phone with his mother talking about our parenting while he was in our home when confronted about it he said basically get over it and that all family s talk about each others parenting and it s a part of being family like it or not and then added don t let it get you down but that it will still happen the problem is the gossiping includes false things for example because we made them wear masks when holding our newborn he refused to hold our son for the first year of his life until we relaxed on the masks that was his choice however he gossiped to the whole family that we wouldn t let him hold his grandson which is extremely inaccurate we ve distanced ourselves from the rest of my husbands family for this reason and don t go to family events anymore because they all make comments like oh you re finally letting him hold your son and at this point we are considering not letting him come around our son and us because we worry if he s comfortable talking about us in our own house what will stop him from talking about us and undermining our parenting to our son when he is old enough to understand i ve tried to calm my husband down who is furious about the whole thing and preserve their relationship because my mother passed away last year and i feel like this is the last real grandparents my son has but i can t expect my husband to let it go forever and to be honest if it was my family i would have cut them off a long time ago i also feel like i can t go to my mom for advice since she is no longer with us so i m coming here in hopes of advice on how to handle this,0,0.04,0.96,0.04,0.04

subvocalization vs seeing a movie as you read tl dr when you read do you speak the words in your head or is it like being immersed in a movie so i was reading the comments on another post about subvocalization hearing words in your head as you read as if someone is speaking them with the prevailing theory being that people who don t subvocalize are actually skimming and have lesser reading comprehension i read faster than i could speak and i thus don t subvocalize but i do think i read all the words i only skim if i m bored i start out with hearing echoes of prosody but not specific words and then when i get deep into the book it s like a movie playing in my head when all is going well i am no longer aware of my body or even the fact that i m reading i m just enjoying the movie sometimes i m actually experiencing it as if i were the narrator main character there are times when i get kicked out of movie mode for a second if something doesn t make sense and i have to go back and reread but the movie comes back in fact when i m not into a book the movie doesn t come and i usually abandon it the movie even happens sometimes with nonfiction my question then is has anyone else experienced this or is everyone else very conscious of the words while they re reading or something in between i d love to make a poll but i think it s prevented by this sub,1,0.81,0.19,0.81,0.18999999999999995

yr old getting handsy at daycare this is literally the first real parenting behaviour thing i ve had to deal with and i have no clue where to start generally my husband and i both do child led parenting which basically means that as long as he s not killing himself or others he s been free to do whatever he wants he s been an only child for a while and only recently gained a mth old sister montessori teachers have mentioned on separate occasions that he s been handsy with the other kids pushing grabbing they say that none of the other kids have had any issues with aggressiveness so he couldn t have learned it at school however i ve peeked in and seen other kids lightly push him before the teachers are telling us to reinforce a hands to yourself mantra at home but we re not sure what else to do because he literally has no other kids learn to push around any school he s at a tricky age where he listens but doesn t actually listen learn if you know what i mean i don t want to become those special snowflake parents but i literally don t have any experience to stop the behaviour any advice is he doomed to be that aggressive kid forever is it just a lot of cha new baby and he s just acting out,0,0.05,0.95,0.05,0.05
thoughts on reading a retelling but not knowing the original story i do this a lot because i just didn t read like fairytales and other popular classics that probably i should know i never read beauty and the beast but i have read so many retellings of it i wonder if it changes the reader s experience if they knew the original story another instance when i did this is read the dark descent of elizabeth frankenstein without ever reading frankenstein then i read frankenstein but found the dark descent of elizabeth frankenstein more compelling,1,0.99,0.01,0.99,0.010000000000000009
the origins of the count of monte cristo i m sure most fans of the dumas s epic the count of monte cristo have heard about its connection to dumas s father but less well known is its actual origin this is not to say that his father s life did not inspire the story in any way but once you look into this real life count of monte cristo story the life of pierre picaud no doubt will remain as to the inception of the long loved tale if you have already read the book i highly suggest reading the police files turned narrative of pierre picaud here if like me you thought that the count of monte cristo while making for a brilliant story pushed the boundaries of possibility then the uncanny events found in the archives of the police de paris will make the narrative all the more believable and spectacular from the humble young man betrothed to his love framed by jealous conspirators to the starving prisoner who forms a friendship with an italian abbe in the next cell who bestows upon him immeasurable wealth to the illustrious and vengeful count the events you read in this will be hard to grasp as factual events that occurred in the past i hope you enjoy reading about it as much as i did,1,0.97,0.03,0.97,0.030000000000000027

books that can t be audiobooks what novels do you think are unaudiobookable and why what about the physical medium of books makes the experience better than simply listening to the words being spoken amp x b we re all familiar with the notion that books are hard to adapt into in films and television but i d argue that novels don t always lend to being audiobooks either in spite of how often the two mediums are seen as interchangeable for instance probably the least audiobookable novel i can think of is the life and opinions of tristram shandy gentleman by laurence sterne this is because that novel employs so many visual elements and is so interested in exploring what can be done with the novel as a physical object another hard to adapt novel would be war and peace by leo tolstoy because of the many passages of dialogue spoken in french which are then translated into english by the author in the footnotes on the page this is done as elegantly as such a scheme can possibly be where there is little guessing what is and is not being said in french while in an audiobook the idea that the characters are speaking french may be almost completely lost or at least deemphasized to the listener,1,0.97,0.03,0.97,0.030000000000000027

a thousand splendid suns i finished a thousand splendid suns by khaled hosseini today and it s incredible it s a culture shock a ticket to a whole other world he puts you in the shoes of women with lives and hardships i couldn t begin to fathom the things they went through the incredible loss and uncertain future hosseini has you feel all of it the entire time we re also witnessing afghanistan with the rise and fall of the soviets jihad and then the taliban i didn t include spoilers because everyone should experience the book blind there are moments where i audibly gasped or yelled or said oh shit i m struggling to artfully articulate exactly what i m feeling right now about this story i can t find the words for it i wholeheartedly recommend this book to everyone it s deep insightful heart wrenching and enchanting it s incredible the only trouble i had reading the story was making connections with the names and places they were hard for me to pronounce and remember not so much the names of the main characters or places like kabul but a few of the minor fleeting names often slipped my mind the craziest thing for me was seeing a different side in a horrible situation a long time ago one of the men in my family was killed at the hands of the taliban in afghanistan ever since my stepmother and grandma ranted and raved about how horrible the people of afghanistan are taliban and civilians alike though i never bought much into their condemnations of the civilians seeing the distrust and equal if not more dislike for them is comforting which sounds weird to say and i hope the meaning of that isn t skewed i m not pleased about their suffering not in the slightest but my family always talked about how thankful the people of afghanistan were for the taliban and in the story they do cheer for the arrival of the taliban at one point however their hopes for a brighter future were quickly dashed because they were duped i know the book is fiction but it s realistic fiction there must be some truth to it i m an american blessed with opportunities and privileges i often disregard or forget this book makes me remember what i have and should be thankful for it also reminds me of the suffering of others in a place i know so little about,1,0.9,0.1,0.9,0.09999999999999998

the great gadsby includes spoilers just recently i have finished reading the great gadsby only in the recent months have i got deeper into fiction books i have previously read american psycho and consequently moved onto the great gadsby i decided to write a little plot review with some of my thoughts about the book i have never been part of a book club of such and never had the chance to discuss a book with others who have too read it so please do feel free to discuss and possibly challenge my thoughts i m looking forward to hearing from everyone i feel that the book reflects the pursuit of the american dream and the consequent monotony that surrounds it once one is achieved all of the characters minus nick the narrator find themselves in the higher classes all indulge in fine cars fine parties servants and great houses the book mainly resolves around gatsby nick s notorious neighbour gatsby is known for his parties and the celebrities that are known to attend his premises on the daily it is later found out that gadsby lives this lifestyle to edge himself closer to his long lost love daisy gatsby has known daisy for a long time and before he went out to war was in a relationship with her once he went out to war the bond fizzled away and daisy found comfort in the hands of a different man tom buchanan a well off rich man this allowed daisy to stay within the higher classes and remain in the position she feels she belongs in a position she would risk losing should she have waited on gatsby to come back after the war who would have to start from the bottom to build his position in the country going back to the point in the beginning of the last paragraph gatsby following his fortunes would flaunt his wealth with his great house and his lavish parties by doing so he wanted to get daisy s attention and highlight his success hoping this would sway her towards him again with the help of nick who has known daisy for years he is able to invite her to nick s house having the opportunity right on his plate he consequently invites the rest of the party over to his house to further showcase his success and provide more reasons for daisy to leave tom for him despite daisy professing her love for gatsby she never completely decides to leave her husband it could be said that her husband provides her with the stability and security that she has always prioritised even though her marriage could be loveless and full of lies tangibly it serves her well and all of her materialistic needs are met despite gatsby similarly being well off financially she possibly seems him as someone desperate and even stating oh you want too much i feel that entering such relationship would put too much pressure on her to love the pressure she does not have to experience with her husband tom who does not expect any real affection and instead expects her to look well in front of others and her being his trophy wife,1,0.72,0.28,0.72,0.28

do you pay attention to the length of the book of course within reason as an aspiring writer i have encountered literary agents bias towards books whose lengths are barely beyond the genre standard specifically in my case the book is only pages larger than this standard of course i personally have no problem shortening these pages but i was extremely surprised that a particular literary agent refused to even read two paragraphs of my book s synopsis after seeing the size of the manuscript at the same time he immediately added that he would not mind looking at my book again as soon as i cut it can pages really make a difference i personally have read at least several thousand books in my life and never even thought about their length of course within reasonable limits i m not talking about those books that are or even times larger than the standard one what do you say would you even notice that the book is pages thicker and does the length of the book matter to you at all,1,0.96,0.04,0.96,0.040000000000000036

so glad to be reading cynthia voigt s homecoming with my amp yo privileged kids i grew up pretty poor and somewhat neglected and likely because of that i became an avid reader thankfully my grandmother who mostly raised me lived near a library so reading was my absolute refuge especially since i didn t have many friends or much access to the television most of the adults in my life didn t pay much attention to me because they were all usually involved in a lot of drama and i was a quiet kid who just wanted to be left alone to read i did not fit in and i think we were all mutually relieved that i stayed out of trouble and out of everyone s business i wasn t absolutely destitute in that i always had my own bed hand me down clothes from cousins and usually at least meals a day but i didn t have a lot of raising or love i was a lonely child but not necessarily alone because i had books in fact most of my major childhood memories revolved around the stories i was reading at the time i d reread the same books over and over again either because it was all i could access or because they felt so familiar and like home to me homecoming by cynthia voigt was one of them if you are unfamiliar with homecoming it s a story about siblings between the ages of whose mother leaves them and they set out traveling by foot to find a distant aunt they ve never met with less than and a paper sack of clothing they live day by day and are resourceful to keep each other fed safe and together as a kid i would pretend to be the main character year old dicey and carry around a paper sack with a set of clothes and walk around a local park trying to fish and make my own stew out of whatever edible plants i could find i had a library book i often checked out about how to find edible roots and plants looking back i think i had an anxiety that one day i might need to be as resourceful as the kids in the book given how little my family noticed or seemed to care about me i found the story to be a great source of comfort and admired the sibling camaraderie i would never experience thankfully i grew up to find my own path towards a comfortable life i worked hard for with my own family whom i dote on and will never let feel as neglected or alone as i once did and i remained an avid reader who still finds refuge in a book i ve always read to my children and not just picture books but i like to pick out ya novels to read aloud to them we ve read many of the classics and recently finished the neverending story and island of the blue dolphins we ve all come to treasure our chapter a day routine but recently i ve been increasingly aware of the fact that they are growing up without real awareness of their priviledge also as some context my kids are mixed race and light skinned as their father is white and i am mexican sure we ve talked about it but they don t really know what it feels like to not always be sure if they will get their next meal and what it really feels like to be hungry or what it s like to be scared to tell someone that you are down to one pair of underwear or to feel like you are a burden or invisible so naturally i ve turned to what i know best to help them to make sense of diverse living situations literature we are about chapters into homecoming and it s just rocking them their first question has been if i d ever leave them like the mother does in the first few pages not really a spoiler since that s the premise of the whole book this was an easy thing to reassure them of the answer is never they are also becoming more cognizant of money and how far a dollar can really go we went to the grocery store the other day and i gave them each as an exercise like dicey to try to make a meal for their dinner they took it more seriously than i thought they would and kept saying how hard it was to make a full meal that wasn t junk food my older son wanted to buy the same things dicey did one day chicken wings potatoes and a quart of milk it was more than and i could see my kids processing the difficulty of poverty yesterday i took them out on a mile walk this isn t unusual for us since we live near some beautiful hiking trails but i reminded them that the tillerman kids were walking up to miles a day likely on shoes not as well made as theirs my youngest who is so much like the youngest in the book sammy had so much more empathy for their long walk when reading today than he had previously and i can t help but keep coming up with other ways to help them live through some of the scenarios that come up in the book to help them see the challenge of being poor and living on the fringes of society s priviledge the book is really pushing us all it s pushing me to show them beyond the comfort of our world i ve made for them and how i can sustain this perspective of empathy beyond just this one story and these characters situations and it s pushing them to see life through a completely different lens one that i hope stays with them i highly recommend the read for younger kids and even adults it s been a powerful experience thus far anyone else read this book i d be curious to hear others perspectives i d also love to hear recommendations of other books we can read together as well,1,0.66,0.34,0.66,0.33999999999999997

just finished reading lord of the flies and after looking about online i ve found that people criticise it for portraying humans as evil creatures who are kept tame by society s orderly veil once i finish reading a book i tend to search around to read reviews or watch videos about it just so that i can let the story sink in after reading lord of the flies i did just this spoiler warning a lot of the reviews negative ones mention that this story is unrealistic in the sense that humans aren t bound to kill each other when left to their own devices in nature they say that this just isn t how people act and that the idea of prepubescent boys devolving into savages is unlikely but do they forget how ruthless humans have been all throughout history i guess the idea of once civilised children turning to savages can seem far fetched but turn to any point in history and look at the countless wars that involve multiple highly civilised nations i m just confused as to why they use this as a point saying humans are not evil when there are numerous real life examples of exactly that humans being evil anyone have any thoughts,1,0.86,0.14,0.86,0.14

candy by kevin brooks what s your opinion on this book i personally loved this book i really liked everything about this book from how candy and joe met each other to what joe did to be able to see candy but one thing i didn t like was the events in the end how she made a choice of not following mike and because of that she was no longer able to see joe yes she was out of prostitution but maybe if she would ve listened to mike things would have ended even better but i can t say that the ending or any other events in this book made this book any worse i am m and i consider this book my favourite due to the emotional impact it had on me after i finished reading this book and if being honest i kinda wanted to have what joe had but not in the events of this book or maybe even in such events but definitely i wouldn t want to have things end like they did in the end where joe and candy weren t be able to see each other which made me really sad that s my opinion on this book and i want to know what others thin of it,1,0.95,0.05,0.95,0.050000000000000044

klara and the sun by kazuo ishiguro was absolutely wonderful if you read never let me go and enjoyed it you will also enjoy klara and the sun the two books are like sister companions because they both touch on human frailty and are in a similar universe klara was more uplifting and the reader was not left in the dark as much as nlmg i don t know how to categorize the genre of the book because it is technically science fiction but not the space opera type like star wars et al maybe it is a speculative fiction if there is such a thing as that anyhow the novel deals with loneliness in a dystopian future on a teenager level i know that this is not much of a review and is extremely spoiler free because i highly recommend this terrific novel from a nobel laureate this was the kind of book that reminds me why i love reading in short i cannot recommend this book enough and wanted to hear what other people thought,1,0.98,0.02,0.98,0.020000000000000018
need book recommendations for a non native i am at a level that communication is no longer an issue but you can say that i have hit a plateau where you are no longer a novice but you aren t a native either reading level shouldn t be an issue for me as long as the language isn t heavily slang based or takes the archaic route it would be highly preferred if the tone is conversational besides it would be great if there are no grammatical errors made by the author like i loved post office by charles bukowski but some sentences seemed grammatically incorrect even to the natives that i contacted and the language was heavily influenced by slangs everything else about the book was great specific problems that i want to work upon i need to learn as many verbs and phrasal verbs as possible i particularly lack here to learn popular phrases and idioms examples to ring a bell things going south good book a walk in the park etc if you have seen the movie the nightcrawler you would have noticed that the protagonist always talks as if he is giving a sales pitch perhaps to show that he has mostly attained his knowledge from the internet and has had very less social interactions i have been accused of the same problem though his delivery is very monotone with slight passive aggressiveness i don t sound that creepy i have been told that i sound too profesional all the time i want to strike a balance between the informal and buisness english the genres i would prefer though i would be reading mostly with the purpose of improving my language and enjoyment would be a bonus to it i think a phrase exists that expresses this sentence better but as i said i am weak in this area still it would be preferred if they are in the genres mentioned i am a sucker for psychological thrillers especially the ones where a character is determined to get something no matter if the ways are wrong i also love coming of age novels i would also like teen romance as long as everything doesn t get sorted out at the prom night important i abhor anything in the fantasy genre or anything grandeur anything about kings and queens is a big no only recommend anything in this genre if it ticks all the other boxes on a second read the post seems quite aggressive and demanding which is not the actual case thank you for your help,1,0.77,0.23,0.77,0.22999999999999998
once upon a time in hollywood quentin tarantino this is the first novel by the filmmaker but he s previousl published a few of his screenplays adapted django unchained into a graphic novel and written django zorro as a graphic novel sequel once upon a time in hollywood is not a straight forward novelisation of the film and in a lot of ways the changes from the film allow tarantino to play to the strengths of the novel format while the film is better suited to the possibilities of film for example the next to final scene of the film where cliff booth and rick dalton receive visitors is missing from the novel and although it was brilliant in the film a description of what happens would be far less effective than the scene in the film instead tarantino uses the novel to delve deeper into some of his characters than it might have been possible to do effectively on film at many points in the novel it feels like reading notes or character background tarantino may have written for the film but he does this to brings themes of ego arrogance and modesty and reputation to the forefront tarantino delves further into cliff booth s past and the way in which and the reasons for which the hollywood stunt world has turned against him rick dalton and the stories that surround him are presented in more detail too as a result while booth becomes a little bit deeper but less sympathetic a character dalton becomes more sympathetic but on the whole shallower a scene towards the end of the novel in which dalton discusses a specific anecdote from his past is simply wonderful and brings everything together quite brilliantly tarantino also takes us on a quick tour of charles manson s ambitions and motivations too whether this was tarantino paraphrasing existing facts or coming to his own conclusions it is quite intriguing and perfectly matched to the themes of the book vanity and image play a part too but they re presented from a far different perspective than for example in kill bill instead they prove to be a kind of necessary undesirable tool for sharon tate this takes on extra impact considering what she is perhaps most remembered for in the real world tarantino also gives his thoughts on cinema through these characters this is probably part of what i personally was hoping for whether i realised it or not there s a paragraph in which he compares american and european cinema from after world war ii which gives fascinating insight however these musings have a terrible effect on the pacing of the novel personally i didn t mind too much in this instance but this is an area that should have been better edited there is also an anecdote or story that is effectively repeated three times it s actually the background to the story behind the tv show that dalton is guest starring on this makes the repetition even more grating it is so far removed from the actual plot of the novel the editing obviously should have been tighter the repetition adds to the uncomfortable feeling at this stage in the novel that the novel is composed of background notes rather than an attempt to tell a focused story the pacing is never perfect but tarantino does bring his story together in the end and the new direction he takes is inevitably quite satisfying there s a short section where he flashes forward to what happens after a scene that appears in the film but not the book and in doing so it actually feels like tarantino is poking around at what s possible in the novel format or perhaps investigating what it might allow him to do in the future,1,0.95,0.05,0.95,0.050000000000000044

i m having a hard time getting into whose body by dorothy l sayers after receiving this book as a gift from my sister i was excited to read it so i could share my opinion and join in on conversations about it she only got it for me because i said that i enjoyed the sherlock holmes books and that she thought whose body was another murder mystery type story i would enjoy after getting around pages in of the book i ve realised i m struggling to read it it s not that i don t like the genre as like previously stated i thoroughly enjoyed sherlock holmes so therefore i narrowed it down to being a problem with the writing that s what i m assuming it is i find difficulty in imaging what is happening in the book and i feel like the pacing is off i m no expert on literature so i don t know what the problem actually is i can vividly picture scenes and conversations in other books but with this one i just can t it seems like the author doesn t describe surroundings very well or at all during parts of the book which may be where the trouble for me comes from for anyone who has read this or those who have been in a similar situation and can give advice on how i should approach this novel it would be greatly appreciated,1,0.85,0.15,0.85,0.15000000000000002
is an inner voice worth getting rid of for the sake of speed i have always had an inner monologue whatever i read i will hear in my head i want to read faster and i know that getting rid of it will help however i find it strikingly difficult to put away the voice in my head the more that i think about it i wonder if it s worth attempting to get rid of i fear that if i do so i won t get the same immersion that i do when my inner monologue reads to me sometimes i have distinguishable voices for different characters or when the mood changes my voice will have a different tone i mostly read fantasy and after finishing rhythm of war a page book i have found that it takes me quite a long time to read i started reading wot and i thought no better time to learn to read faster for those of you that read without an inner monologue do you still feel immersed in a story or do you feel like you often seem to speed through books that you wish you could savor have any of you transitioned from having an inner voice to not having one and if so how did you do it and for anybody else do you think it is worth it for me to try to get rid of my inner monologue or can i most likely learn to read faster without doing so thanks for any help,1,0.98,0.02,0.98,0.020000000000000018
project hail mary a man and a huge ass spider make jazz hands at each other when i posted on this sub about having read the martian and loved it almost every commenter told me to read phm and i am grateful for that i didn t know much about this book going into it i only knew that it had an intelligent alien in it i don t know what i was expecting but it turned out to be even better the plot was an absolute banger the premise about alien microbes threatening humanity s existence is something i have seen before but never like this also the fact that eridians are less advanced they hadn t worked out relativistic physics and whatnot than humans was kinda new to me so that was a pleasant surprise i loved the friendship dynamic between ryland and rocky it was absolutely adorable my only complaint is that the ending could ve been done better i realize this might be an unpopular opinion but i really wanted ryland to go back to earth i m not particularly mad about it to the point of hating it but y know just saying one more thing i could not have been the only one to imagine the interstellar docking sequence music when the hail mary was spinning out of control over adrian right right what were your thoughts on the book,1,0.71,0.29,0.71,0.29000000000000004
i just finished reading siddhartha by hesse i think it might have changed my life sorry if the title is on the dramatic side but i can t overstate how profoundly that book affected me it didn t introduce many new concepts to me but hesse explained these concepts so beautifully and simply that it was as if i were hearing them for the first time i m not an avid reader anymore this is the first book i ve finished in years but i tore through siddhartha in no time i identified with siddhartha s spiritual baselessneess his quest for meaning in a place with so many lifestyles and philosophies yet with no true answer to our suffering the most poignant passage to me would be near the end when siddhartha explains the difference between searching and finding and if you search your whole life you ll miss all the answers that were right under your nose this was the best book i ve ever read i will re read it i will suggest it to anyone i think might find it applicable to their own life and i will continue to ponder the lessons presented by hesse,1,0.98,0.02,0.98,0.020000000000000018
number and number chapter of the count of monte cristo has me hooked so i know this book gets recommended all of the time on here while reading it it felt kind of like i was reading a play instead of a novel but this chapter was fantastic and totally engaged me describing all of the different ways that edmund felt about prison and reading the internal thoughts he had was so interesting it reminded me a lot of the wall by sartre i was reading rather slowly but blew through three chapters last night after that one very excited to see what else this book has in store,1,0.81,0.19,0.81,0.18999999999999995
about my feeling in count of monte cristo edmond was consumed by hatred and believing to be close if not equal to god owner of infinite wisdom and being omnipotent he realized that he can make mistakes and is not omnipotent when he failed to save edoard s life controlled by guilt he realized that he had become corrupt and cruel he forgave danglar to soothe his guilty conscience because he caused the death of an innocent edmond who found himself above all above good and evil who could break social rules he realized the consequences of his actions and that he committed the sin of pride i m glad there wasn t a duel between mondego and edmond especially like in the movie that was poorly done when i see the duel between dolokhov and pierre in series war and peace with paul dano what kevin reynolds did i realize how the english series is the best or that albert is edmond s son and they become close would be the same thing as fyodor karamazov suddenly having paternal feelings for smerdyakov in the brothers karamazov the attempt to soften and justify the marriage between mondego and mercedes in the movie would be similar to trying to soften and even soften the affair between anatole and natasha in war and peace the count of monte cristo was no longer edmond dantes he was already a completely different person he not only sat in prison for years although this alone will make a person different he learned a new philosophy thanks to his guru abbot faria no and one more time no first the count and mercedes are not the same as edmond and mercedes the hero became a different person and this person could no longer have anything in common with mercedes and of course she also changed edmond calls haydee the second mercedes and somewhere deep down they still love each other but it turned out that only mercedes remained unhappy her husband died her son left her and she is also poor and completely in grief she is married she has not yet learned the terrible truth she also lived with fernand for a reason there was something she has a son and the father of this son will shoot himself in general thanks to the count of monte cristo it s all very complicated if she had married anyone else the ending might have been different but in this situation i can hardly imagine how they forgetting about everything will be together again the writer aleksandr solzhenitsyn who wrote the famous book the gulag archipelago he was no different with his first wife who acted as mercedes and how he met his second wife who unlike haydee she was married when she divorced her husband to marry him his family that was a victim of stalin couples who were separated as in the book and only met in the movie and that s all in rela life it was different,1,0.45,0.55,0.45,0.55

to the lighthouse virginia woolf at first i did not care much for mr and mrs ramsay they were rather boring their relations to other family members and friends were mundane and not particularly exciting i read the first pages or so a bit dispassionately amp x b however woolf writes in this cozy manner where you just can t help falling in love with this house beach lighthouse etc the second part of the book was amazing although i felt no particular sympathy towards any character that quickly changed with just a few parentheses and a line or two it was shocking and brutal the war life and death it all felt so ephemeral and yet it was there right up in your face amp x b i can t say i understood the novel completely and i sure can t enjoy stream of consciousness fully i simply need to understand the language better however i believe this is a novel that remains forever somewhere in your heart or brain those images are so beautiful in their simplicity that i cannot stop thinking about them days later a house a lighthouse a beach a painting a husband and his beautiful wife children artists and poets nothing happens and yet everything happens so much life is in this book there is so much to be said about motherhood and marriage when you observe the ramsay family it feels so dreamlike and yet so brutally human amp x b if you have any opinions feel free to share,1,0.49,0.51,0.49,0.51
raskolnikov and existentialism i just finished reading crime and punishment and i really liked how dostoevsky portrayed the protagonist raskolnikov here s a brief rundown of his ideals from my point of view beware of small spoilers he starts off with a plan to kill the pawn broker and rob her in order to benefit the world while it does sound horrible but from a purely utilitarian perspective the plan is perfectly sound yet he can t execute his perfect plan and falls into a spiral of suffering which progressively gets worse throughout the book that s the main plot what i loved about this was his internal monologues and thoughts on everything how he struggles to understand why he was feeling what he was feeling even though his supposed crime was completely justified and done with a rational goal how others who have done significantly worse deeds than him were not only unpunished but instead idolised and so on and so forth he eventually comes to the conclusion that he is perhaps really just an ordinary man and not an extraordinary individual who can overstep social barriers the dread from his absolute freedom and ultimate meaninglessness of his actions now that his great man theory of himself had been disproven breaks him down he finds himself to be completely miserable even though he believes his actions were rational but seeing no way around it he tries to accept that this is his life now this will always stay with him life was suffering and to find meaning within that suffering was his purpose so to say inspired by sonia he tries to find god develop some faith tries to find anything that ll make this entire situation make sense a sort of rejection of reason if it simply meant that he could find an ounce of hope but he fails until the very end he continued his struggle against his ownself his pride and will to keep on fighting out of spite were the only things that kept him going finally he decided that it simply wasn t worth it he gave himself up this internal struggle in raskolnikov was what made me like this book so much his slow transition from rationalism into existentialism he begins by rebelling against himself and society believing himself to be capable enough to undertake such a rebellion but in the end his indomitable spirit is crushed under the sheer weight of the incomprehensible nature of everything in the end he accepts his defeat this book has so many great element it might my favourite book of all time but the aforementioned aspect was the primary thing that attracted me,1,0.88,0.12,0.88,0.12

animal farm short simple lends itself to book reports well but why else do we read it when animal farm was published in most people didn t know much about the soviet union leftist intellectuals even idolized joseph stalin as crazy as that sounds today orwell s animal farm is a brilliant response to this kind of ignorance he takes a dry disturbing and complex subject and simplifies it to something a child could understand before i read the book i thought it was a general description of how communists sought influence in or took over countries around the world i was a little surprised to see how limited the book was to the russian experience it is so specific every character has an exact counterpart in history but that leaves me with a question what s the point of reading animal farm today when all of the cynicism and atrocities of the russian revolution are common knowledge it was a good book for its time and place but the world has moved on there are better books out there on the subject it lends itself well to high school book reports and the novelty of the animals as characters is cute but there are better books out there on the subject,1,0.88,0.12,0.88,0.12

when a character overpowers their opponent and fails to kill them quickly can anyone think of a book that explores the shame and dishonour in failing to put someone something out of their misery quickly especially when it s not a fair fight bc the killer has a big advantage can be in a battle in an execution while hunting etc this was a theme in the horror novel the only good indians by stephen graham jones and it really spoke to me for some reason i think about this every time i play candy crush tournament and come in with super op boosts and still waste the other player s time by taking a long time to win would love to find other books that lean into this trope situation,1,0.87,0.13,0.87,0.13
baby picture funny or in poor taste i m a part of a private instagram account that my brother and his wife made for their new baby boy who is now months old the account has only about followers consisting of his very close family and friends yesterday they posted a picture of my nephew sitting beside a closed bottle of johnnie walker scotch i thought it was cute and had a good laugh because the way he s sitting he just looks like a little man adorable no harm no foul right or maybe not i received a text not two hours later from a concerned older family member asking me to talk to my brother about taking the picture down as it s in poor taste and may make him look like an irresponsible parent i am a parent of a newborn baby myself and admittedly this comment made me question my own judgement as a new mother do you think the family member is overreacting or do you think she has a point let me just state clearly that the picture does not make it look like the baby is drinking the alcohol nor does he look intoxicated in any way he s simply sitting posed beside the bottle,0,0.1,0.9,0.1,0.1

odysseus fought twice in the trojan war once on the actual battlefield once in his own home of ithaca okay so as a non native speaker i had a really hard time formulating that title lol i ll try to explain my thoughts a bit better i m currently taking a lit class where we dissect odyssey and i ve been blown away from how much i ve missed when i first read it before taking this class despite thinking of myself as a good reader i apparently understood nothing lol the professor is very unique with his own approach and i m wondering if other people have also heard of this interpretation and if anyone has a source please share for the love of god i d love to hear everyone s thoughts on this topic in general so a very short summary of what we ve discussed in class hours basically the things that go down in odysseus home in ithaca in his absence are symbolic of what happened in the trojan war the suitors are the younger brothers and sons of the warriors who accompanied odysseus to troy they were too young to take part in what was thought to be the greatest event in history many of them lost their family members who were later hailed as heroes while these kids had to grow up in the shadow of these great heroes who had fallen a decade ago so in a way the suitors marching to odysseus home where they would have tournaments against each other and kind of act like the warriors in troy just on a much smaller scale they missed out on the real troy and their second best option was to go after the man who indirectly caused so much suffering for ithaca after all odysseus was the one who led all the local warriors to their death there are a lot of other complex theorems that can kind of back this idea up that suitors were playing pretend trojan war and i think it could make sense to a lot of yall i know for me it took some time but kinda clicked easily later lol and similarly to the real thing as soon as odysseus got back he fought to win the war for his own home i d love to hear if you guys have any similar theories about this book or any sources where i can look them up in my class we ve discussed some very weird fascinating symbolic stuff like eumaus being the mirrored version or counterpart of odysseus also odysseus being hermes himself this was concluded from the scene when his dog argus recognizes odysseus and dies hermes is known as the killer of argus and odysseus ends up being the killer of argus the dog as well the maniacal descent of telemachus who at some point can t stop brutally killing the suitors and much more haha,1,0.47,0.53,0.47,0.53

eating i m so lost and confused on babies and what they should be eating my son is months we are feeding pur ed baby food because that s what our doctor said we could we have been since months he eats oz containers while at school as well as oz bottles we have them make sometimes he ll eat all sometimes he ll leave an oz in total he drinks around oz of formula a day my main thing is i don t really eat during the day i never have i usually eat one meal and then smaller snacks or meals a day my medications makes my appetite non existent so when everyone says have baby eat what you re eating because i mention wanting to add more solid foods into his diet i draw a blank i cook dinner for his dad after he s asleep because his dad gets home at and puts him to bed when we have tried cut up fruits he just smashes them around his tray which is fine i know eating solid foods isn t really essential until a year but all my friends do blw which is amazing for them they re stay at home moms who have time to prepare all the meals and they themselves all eat normally i m not looking for a debate on pur ed food vs baby led weaning i just want to know what you feed your kid daily approximately how much how often what varieties that sort of thing,0,0.06,0.94,0.06,0.06
should we adopt the sick cat our son loves even if it means he will witness her suffering our year old son returned home today devastated crying his eyes out he seemed so ovewhelmed it took us a good mins to get a word out of him apparently a cat that he had been feeding for the past year was diagnosed with cancer today i haven t seen him so upset in a while he has been crying nonstop refusing to go out refusing to see anyone else besides us including his therapist while repeating over and over that he wants to get cancer like the cat and die he would scream that nobody else cares about the cat dying none of his friends nor the neighbours seemed to be upset at all saying things like this is common and she is an old cat my husband held him in his arms for hours whle he sobbed consoling him he sympathised with his emotions about the sick cat validated his feelings and even though it was an old cat he told him that it s normal to be upset our son kept repeating that he was a sick cat and that all those people wouldn t care if he was sickly in the streets and dying he seemed to experience an intense feeling of betrayal since none of the people he expected comfort from seemed to care about the sick cat as much as he did he then asked us whether we would let him die alone he related so much to that poor cat given we has spent a great portion of his life in the foster care system before he became part of our family i felt my heart cracking at those words both me and my husband held him so tight reassuring him that it would never ever happen and that we would do everything in our human powers to care for him and what he cares for that s when maxy asked whether we could take the cat in and get her treatement we really do want to help the cat in her final moments but we are concerned about max s reaction to her death he seems to believe because i also work in the medical field that by caring for her we might save her somehow which i m afraid is very unlikely we want to fulfill his request but we are wondering whether it s the best choice for him to witness an animal suffering and slowly dying in front of his eyes,0,0.03,0.97,0.03,0.03

vandermeer s ambergris is a misunderstood masterpiece vandermeer is an author best known for annihilation which was made into movie starring natalie portman his earlier trilogy ambergris is obscure enough that it was mostly out of print until a year ago when it was released in as an omnibus after reading through the trilogy in a couple weeks i am convinced it s small following is due to a lack of marketing and readers constantly misunderstanding what they re getting into when they come to it vandermeer employs strange literary devices to describe the interactions of the civilians of the vivid strange city of ambergris at the core vandermeer is writing pure literary works here stylistically he reads far more like mccarthy fitzgerald and hemingway than the typical fantasy fiction juggernauts content wise his stories are streamlined on characters just like any literary work the fantasy elements are included in deeply human ways that force the reader to grapple with the fate of millions and what it means to witness and understand history the books are sadly impossible to market his later work found critical success with annihilation which could be pigeonholed as a thriller for marketing ambergris still sits in the background mostly unread and avoided which a real shame you can classify it as weird fiction but that label will send away most of the readers who will truly love it as you don t really expect to see a mushroom world in literary canon i m fairly well read and i was constantly amazed as vandermeer showed me time and again things i never imagined in a book his later work is more polished and marketable but this early trilogy arguably has more heart in it i wonder if one day ambergris will finally pick up steam and be recognized for what it is,1,0.97,0.03,0.97,0.030000000000000027

the catcher in the rye love it or hate it i m currently reading the catcher in the rye for the first time as pleasure reading and i m really enjoying it so far in a way that i don t often enjoy classics i just really like how holden is written he s one of the most authentic teenagers i ve read so hypocritical and arrogant yet insecure and sad i keep rolling my eyes at him in an affectionate way like he s my embarrassing but ultimately sweet little brother i didn t expect such an old book to feel so honest it s bringing back memories of my own adolescence even though i m different from holden in many different ways gender era class etc but it seems like a ton of people hate this book like hate it and i guess i m curious as to why holden isn t admirable by any means but that s nothing unique to classic literature maybe some people just don t relate to him but i still don t understand why such a large amount of people hate the book i understand not liking classics the house of mirth haunts me to this day but so many people call the catcher in the rye stupid or worthless and that just gets on my nerves because it s far from worthless to me granted i wouldn t have liked it in high school i think it s best appreciated as an adult but still what gives if you ve read the book what did you think of it and why did you read it in school or for fun i d love to know,1,0.78,0.22,0.78,0.21999999999999997
would it be obnoxious to throw my daughter a semi big party my daughter has just finished her first year of school and has made her first proper little friends it s been really fun getting to know them all and their parents i ve been planning my daughter s sixth party since her last one was cancelled last winter and have paid off put down deposits on a few things i e the hall a small petting zoo bouncy castle decorations and face painting was thinking of maybe a little disco too for january we have been invited to a few parties recently and i ve noticed pretty much all of them have been low key i e just playing at the kid s house with party food we had loads of fun and they were great however there was a conversation at one of the parties which pretty much amounted to don t you hate those parents who go over the top at parties to try to show off i sat there sweating because i don t want them to think i am trying to show off by throwing a big ish party for my kid but at the same time i think my daughter deserves it since she has been under lockdown for nearly a year with birthdays visits to see family outings all cancelled it s also her first birthday party with her proper school friends and family but i feel like also maybe it sets the wrong tone for my daughter who might expect it every year i also kind of feel like it might come across as look at how much i can give my kid at a time when lots of people are understandably short this year i m also not well off by any means i am a student relying on my student loan this party has amounted to about overall that i ve spaced out over about years i m thinking of just replanning the whole thing to make it a lot more simple it s not until winter so i have time to think about it but would appreciate some advice would you find me really annoying thanks,0,0.16,0.84,0.16,0.16

just finished anxious people by fredrik backman good read this was my second backman after a man called ove so my expectations were high i was not disappointed as the book took me on a beautiful journey adorned with many quaint manifestations of the universal feelings of love and compassion at first i was a tad disappointed when the crime thriller storyline inched forwards not long after though i realized that the book is mostly not about the temporal arrangement of its events it is about the characters formative stories of their lives and relationships the financial system and bridges the characters are well crafted and a delightful reaction ensues when their anxieties and insecurities are mixed together and catalyzed by the unique setting of their hostage situation backman is masterful at meting out condensed wisdom i loved how banal conversations between characters are often sprinkled with the narrator s perspective revealing a deep understanding of human nature i found myself re reading phrases and grinning while i did it i m eager to pick up my next backman and grateful to this sub for recommending this one to me,1,0.94,0.06,0.94,0.06000000000000005

robert mccammon s swan song is one of the best i have ever read during the quarantine of i did not read a single book or one that i can remember this of course was bad spending all of your time on social media especially a website like twitter will erode your mental health like spending your free time in a radioactive crater eventually you will get cancer and die thankfully though a variety of factors i kicked my addiction to social media and left twitter for good one of those factors was swan song now i am a gamer i play a wide selection of video games and my favorite video game series is fallout you could tell that if you went on my profile and i could go on a rant about how deep fallout new vegas is the excellent world building of fallout and how fallout has literal hundreds of cultural references to other media fallout has made a big part of my identity and shaped who i am but all the entries fallout does get boring after you play it for the thousandth time so i wanted to read something something post apocalyptic like my beloved series but also thoughtful not having just mindless action but not so philosophically it makes your brain cramp out swan song was this firstly i must thank swan song for just making me read again it brushed away a lot of the cobwebs in my mind caused by not reading for an entire year i am still mad i was a dumbass and sent my year on twitter instead of reading and running and playing fallout the extremely bare bones of bare bones plot summary is that the world got nuked and you follow three plotines of survivors joshua and swan sister and paul thorson and colonel macklin and roland croninger i believe the main strength of swan song was not its plot but simply how it is written there is just something that makes you read it eager to know more even though it is pages in my paperback version i barely got tired of it the only times i got frustrated was when i thought it didn t spend enough time on the colonel macklin roland croninger storyline and too much on swan joshua and sister thorson not only that i just realized as i writing this on many plot lines and characters there are the thing is the way mccammon writes is that i remember distinctly which characters are who and their personality they are unique i never groaned when a new character entered the picture i was excited even the minor characters spice up the story in one scene the main antagonist of the book the man with the scarlet eye convinces a woman to kill herself for fun after she finds him doing things with his anatomy humans cannot do little snippets of data about how other groups of humans and communities are doing feel so realistic you seen how people and communities are reacting to the nuclear holocaust so hearing about how people are suffering don t feel like they were added in and actually exist lastly one of the most emphasized parts of the book is on the characters humanity they can get injured disfigured even killed they aren t immortal they feel human emotions like sadness grief jealousy zealotry ruthless but there are moments were they hope laugh love and persevere against the onslaught of this new world one of the morals of the book is that people are people with flaws and all you see the faces of evil quite literally in some parts with the man in the scarlet eye yet there are people like swan who still hope for the best of people and try hard to bring them together to cooperate and not steal to love and to not hate and to replace suspicion with friendship and camaraderie once upon a time humanity had a love affair with fire,1,0.92,0.08,0.92,0.07999999999999996
mother left my toddler y alone at the playground for a toilet break last weekend our anna years old stayed over at my parents place for a night sleepover she has done so a couple of times before always max night and i ve always made sure to align on schedule rules rituals etc during pickup and a cup of coffee my mother casually mentioned that she left my daughter alone on a playground to go to the toilet when i asked why she did this she answered that anna didn t want to come along i replied that coming along is not optional but mandatory and a basic rule of child caring my mother argued that the playground is safe as it charges a small entrance fee and has a fence around it it wasn t until after i had left their place that i got really upset i haven t had such a specific issue but felt uncomfortable with my parents not installing a stair gate not installing a gate in their garden even though it is connected to a body of water etc one of the things i find baffling is that my mother even had the audacity to say ah i realised immediately i shouldn t have told you i d like to ask am i correct in being upset and believing i shouldn t trust my parents to care for my child thanks,0,0.09,0.91,0.09,0.09
just finished norwegian wood by haruki murakami the book made me feel a lot of things especially as a college student myself the isolation and loneliness spoke to me in more ways than one however i had a problem with the way he wrote the female characters it s like how he imagined women as this sort of martyr for staying for awful kinds of men because of love now i know the times had changed from when that book was written and that books aren t necessarily supposed to be a compass of morality but i can t seem to make myself like it as much when i found faults in it what i do like about it though is the whimsical dream like structure it had it felt like i was floating with the words as the main character drifted in his own world i was awfully fond of their conversations even if they were talking about random things i got so invested in it and in their mundane hangouts that it makes me want to be able to create relationships like that with other people minus the random sex scenes that i also found very strange why does sex always have to be the answer okay just trying to put into words what i ve read,1,0.94,0.06,0.94,0.06000000000000005
i love reading author s notes afterword preface i just finished reading to sleep in a sea of stars by christopher paolini and i was thinking that book was pretty eh pretty okay nothing to write home about and then i read the afterword and it was an adventure i tell you poor guy spent over nine years on this book but he has good humor about it gt to quote rolfe humphries from the foreword to his translation of the aeneid virgil one can well believe having worked on the poem for over a decade had reached the point where he felt he would rather do anything including die than go over the poem one more time paolini knows the book is eh but he did it he finished it i got so invested when reading his note and i was rooting so hard for him to get the book published that by the end i was smiling like and mad man and telling my family about his great accomplishment it really changed my disposition and i m excited to see what paolini comes out with next amp x b however the top spot for my favorite notes foes to niel gaiman sometimes i find myself looking forward to reading those a bit more than the book itself in good omens gaiman and pratchett have some funny banter my personal favorite gt agnes nutter scenes and the kids mostly originated with terry the four horsemen and anything that involved maggots started with neil amp x b what are some author s notes that you particularly like,1,0.74,0.26,0.74,0.26
my y o son is fascinated by all things evil and i m not sure how i feel about it it started when he was maybe with star wars he loved the empire the stormtroopers darth etc while playing the sw video game he always played as agents of the empire we thought it was kinda cute and funny but a pattern has emerged the other night we watched neverending story together i was curious how he would react to the death of the horse scene that scene tore me up as a kid his reaction was welp looks like your horse is dead now just so flat and matter of fact about it near the end of the movie there s a scene where the protagonist fights to the death with a demon wolf creature and kills it my son was upset by the wolf s death when watching superman or batman type shows he always roots for the evil criminal genius nemesis just today he told me he wanted to be a friday the th jason like killer for halloween a guy with a white hockey mask and a chainsaw were his words he doesn t watch these movies or anything he must ve gotten the idea from a cartoon gravity falls or something he often makes up stories of blowing up worlds and ruling over the universe etc it s all super imaginative y o type of narrative but still why does he always want to be the bad guy he s a sweet good hearted kid and he s not like hurting animals or burning grasshoppers with a magnifying glass or anything like that he s just naturally drawn to the dark side thinks it s awesome fascinated by power stuff like that when i ask him why he likes the bad guys more than the good guys he gets very vague and quiet it s just totally odd to me because when i was his age i wanted to be superman luke skywalker etc he wants to be lex luthor and the emporer as a kid i was fascinated by dracula and the wolfman and kinda folklorish monsters but more in a facing fear fun being scared in safety kinda way i love horror movies at least older ones that had an element of fun camp or some kinda redemptive quality most contemporary horror is too bleak dark hopeless and depressing for me so maybe that just got passed down through the dna or something but i don t think i fascinated about or desired to be the object of evil overthinking this worried for nothing thoughts,0,0.26,0.74,0.26,0.26

is wheel of time like harry potter do people love the books for the books themselves or the nostalgia of reading them hi hello now before you grab your pitchforks because i compared two completely different books series let me clarify harry potter is one of my favorite series of all time i can reread and enjoy it still find depth and layers to it i didn t necessarily notice or care about when i was younger but that s also kind of the thing i first read the books when i was younger so part of why i love the books so much is because of the nostalgia and what the books meant to me growing up upon reread they re still good but i also can understand how if an adult were to pick them up for the first time now they might not like them that being said is wheel of time like that to some extent i ve read the first book and am halfway through the second one and it was okay not bad but not quite up to the hype this isn t a short series so if i m going to invest my time i d like to know if especially for those who read it later on it s worth it i don t want to keep going waiting for it to get to the really good part only to be books with nothing to show for it if that makes sense so yes thoughts opinions any sort of discussion is super welcome thank you in advance,1,0.95,0.05,0.95,0.050000000000000044

year old girl always already wet when going to use the potty is this normal my almost yo daughter was a pro a potty training it took a weekend when she was and hasn t had an accident since my year old on the other hand has been a struggle she was almost before we told her she has to start using the potty we had tried and failed many times before that but we finally decided to just spend a week setting timers and taking her to the potty all the time it took a week before she actually went in the potty and she has had many accidents since well it s been a year now and while the full on accidents happen less often we still have to change her underwear multiple times a day we make her go to the potty about every hours and constantly ask her if she needs to go but every time we get her on the potty and pull down her pants her underwear is already damp with pee every time we just don t understand how or why it s happening every time we haven t even tried night time training yet because the day time training isn t going well and i feel like we need to conquer that before we start the night time training i brought it up to her doctor at her year check up and her doctor said it was normal she had also had a uti right before that appointment that we had to go to an urgent care for but the doctor said the antibiotics should have killed any infection but there was also a checkup when she was around where we saw a nurse practitioner who when checking her diaper area said she has something wrong with her urethra opening like a flap that s closed or something i can t for the life of me remember what she called it and google is no help but she said that it usually corrects itself as they get older i don t know if it s connected to the issues she s having now but i wanted to bring it up in case someone else has experience with it or knows what it s called i was talking to my sil about it today and she was discussing it with her mom her mom said maybe she has a bladder infection i sent a message to her doctor tonight explaining all of this and asking if she should be seen but i just wanted to know if anyone else has dealt with this constant damp underwear in their girls and if it was normal she s also starting preschool next month so we are really trying to get this under control tl dr yo girl always has damp underwear from pee when she goes potty have been potty training for a year now and still have this issue every time she goes to the potty don t know if it s normal in some kids or if there could be something wrong would like some input experiences with this issue,0,0.02,0.98,0.02,0.02

book recommendations for dad so my dad hasn t read many books but is trying to get into it he has so far read the hunger games series and the inheritance games i don t really know what else to recommend him i am thinking of staying in the ya genre because i absolutely do not want to hand him something like an adult novel with explicit scenes in it he also is a non native english speaker and i don t want to hand him something has has even me drifting off it needs to be engaging and the two things he has read has been from ya so i don t think he really like fantasy type novels so maybe nothing that needs too much world building though he has never even read one so he could just not know how good it can be defiantly something witty and clever he likes underdog stories thanks guysss,1,0.81,0.19,0.81,0.18999999999999995
a study in scarlet spoilers this post contains spoilers amp x b a study in scarlet was a turning point both for novels and me for me it was the first detective mystery novel i ve read and for books it was the first time a magnifying glass was used in a detective novel and the first time sherlock holmes featured in a novel yes this is the origin point the start the genesis of sherlock holmes it all started here in this book written by sir arthur conyn doyle amp x b first i need to say that holme s methods were revolutionary his method of deduction for instance proves that the smallest things are also clues also i have no doubt that by modern standards holmes would likely be seen as neurodiverse being that he knew next to nothing else his limits were documented by dr watson near the beginning of the book amp x b speaking of dr watson the book is written from his perspective he was a doctor at the british army and was drafted into the war at afghanistan yes it s been going on for a long time but got hurt and had to return his injuries made him slightly disabled and he couldn t afford to keep living on his own he learned of sherlock holmes through a friend who said that holmes was looking at moving to b baker street and was looking for a companion amp x b no doubt sherlock holme s abilties were amazing back in the day being that he could identify a cigar or tobacco from the ash work out how high someone is what shoes they were wearing and explore every possibility unlike lestrade or gregson of scotland yard who seem rather narrow minded compared to holmes for instance they believed the murder had been done by a woman named rachel due to a wedding ring and the word rache written in blood at the scene amp x b the book is in two parts the first part concerns the brixton road mystery itself and the second part concerns the person who did the murder telling exactly what he did which lines up awfully well with what sherlock had found out himself from simply surveying the crime scene with a tape measure and magnifying glass and applying his well known skills to the data yes he called it data it s actually a very old word amp x b you also learn of holme s appreciation of the violin both of himself playing it and watching norman neruda at one point dr watson alludes to holmes using drugs amp x b there s so much to talk about so i reccomend just reading it it s not that long either and it s a classic and a great book well worth reading,1,0.82,0.18,0.82,0.18000000000000005
do you rate satire higher i have come to a recent realization that i may rate satire higher than normal books because i take the whole genre into account when i do what i mean is say a book is very tongue and cheek about subverting the genre standards perhaps even referencing and taking the piss on antiquated themes and motifs i love that shit it is high comedy now obviously ratings and such are subjective and my own scale is set on readability more than quality but do you think a book should be judged on its own merits or can it be fairly judged based on external factors do you personally rate satire higher i guess a similar outlook could be judging social commentary stories by their real world counterparts rather than their own narrative strength,1,0.86,0.14,0.86,0.14

daughter invited on vacation with friend s family my year old daughter was invited to go on vacation with a friend s family this is very last minute going within the next weeks and not planned for by us at first my daughter felt it would be too stressful to go since it was so close to school starting and she is currently on vacation with her dad we coparent i did not try to change her mind in this even though i thought it might be something she would really enjoy i didn t want to talk her into something that would add stress in her life she told me tonight that she decided she does want to go but apparently she will not be back from her current vacation by the time they leave she would need to fly on her own and then drive home with them when they cone back i just found out that we would need to pay for her plane ticket and other things while she is on this trip this is not in my budget i have a newborn that just started daycare per month and i also need to buy my daughter clothes and supplies to go back to school i texted her dad about it and he acts like it s no big deal he has a lot more money than me he also manages it better to be honest and lives in a much more expensive area which is where my daughter goes to school i lt is something we ve dealt with because her friends are quite rich and it influences her wants needs i usually end up paying for a lot more things because my daughter s dad says no to everything and she is afraid to ask him for things she needs i just don t think i can afford this trip i don t even know his much it is and it s making me feel pretty shitty i know this shouldn t matter but the family that invited her is loaded the daughters spent k on their credit cards in one month i just don t think i would invite someone s kid on vacation and expect them to pay for anything so i guess i m just trying to understand what others would do in this situation,0,0.07,0.93,0.07,0.07

if this book would be demon i would be demonslayer extinction thomas bernhard it took my months to finish this book you should have seen the smile on my face when i switched to a light book wanderer by knut hamsun after this one i became like the protagonist in big stan who after heavy training finds it more comfortable when he goes to prison most importantly i learned to tame my demon i was able to have fun by finishing reading a book that might have been boring for me when i turned the last page of the book i entered a new page inside me i was a little hasty in reading the book at first and then i didn t touch it for months then when i got home from work i promised myself to only read pages and i wanted to do it only to move on to the next book but i didn t have to wait for the next book to read a book i love because my approach to reading ensured that the book i was holding was one i already loved the way to read boring books is not to rush finishing book to go to the next book i m talking about literary works here it can often be more profitable to drop the book in pulp novels but to spread it out over a long period of time i m talking about literary works here but you can never predict what you will find in literary works in the next pages of the book or in taste left over on your palate even after you finish the book thomas bernhard really know what literary is if you want to witness it and do it with fun i definitely recommend the loser by him modern and classical works are like egg white and yolk when you mix and read them you can only get an omelet while there is a placeless idea in modern works there is a space that holds the event in classical works when i read such works one after the other i am inspired by what time and space are,1,0.88,0.12,0.88,0.12

finished frozen in time the fate of the franklin expedition by owen beattie amp john geiger it describes the research that was done in the s on the lost franklin expedition that started in even after years they found some new evidence that shed some light on why this exploration failed so horribly the book starts with some descriptions on the preparations of the exploration and the people that joined this doomed mission especially sir john franklin the eerie focus is on the tin canes that they took along with them with later turned out the key part of all the investigations the first field mission from the describes the collection of some bones and artifacts they found while following the traces of the mission the bone analysis they did on the found bones there started the theory of lead poisoning the confirmation of this theory is then the core of the rest of the book what makes this first field mission description is that you can emphasize a tiny little what franklin s man could have felt when they arrived the authors describe the landscape and also the dangers they encountered ice bears ice in general coldness and hunger it must be very beautiful there but so very dangerous the main part of the book describes the exhumation of the three buried sailors in the permafrost what made this extraordinary are the well preserved corpses almost as if they had recently been buried they could learn a lot from this the exhumation is described in detail and with a lot of dignity to the sailors they exhumed the conclusions they made from there discoveries and the exhumation are explained nicely it is all very thorough and there are no sudden conclusions even after all the evidence they digged deeper and tried to confirm it more a very nice scientific read i hoped for a little bit more on the re discovery of the lost ships in s it is only very briefly touched but that discovery probably deserves its whole own book i m kind of obsessed with the franklin expedition since reading the michael palin book about the terror and erebus it is such a tragedy all in the name of science and maybe even more in the name of british glory that killed man in one of the most dreadful ways imaginable frozen and starved to death while weakened by lead poisoning the general obsession comes from wooden ships if somebody can recommend me any book about this topic travel journals technical detail books history books even fiction novels that have a setting on wooden ships i will gladly take it all,1,0.95,0.05,0.95,0.050000000000000044
currently reading crime and punishment what do you think about the book im currently reading crime and punishment by dostoevsky and i can say with confidence that this is on of the best books i have ever read if not the best the way you are welcomed into the charecters mind and the harsh realistic nature of the book is just fascinating the depth that every living person on this book has is just mind blowing and i also love how the plot revolves itself around tha main charecter that is the villain not only of the story but also of himself i could spend hours talking about how i love this book but i dont rly want to give any spoilers to people that still havent read the book to sum it all up this is the second book of russian literature that i have ever read and i just love it i would love to hear your opinion about this book or author or if you re reading it right now tell me how your experience has been so far,1,0.95,0.05,0.95,0.050000000000000044
how do you handle negative reviews of books you like i ll admit i have a knee jerk reaction to someone posting they didn t like a game of thrones or fight club but have to remember to actually read what the people said first and address their points there s a difference between someone saying the book was not their cup of tea but understands its popularity and blatantly saying a book is trash with no redeeming qualities so how do you react seeing a book you cherish and is close to your heart getting down voted,1,0.86,0.14,0.86,0.14
odd situation newly pt d ds prefers to wear a pull up instead of undies so a bit lost with this one as my older ds absolutely could not wait to be done with diapers pull ups and start wearing big boy undies younger ds potty trained last month and has done great so far only accidents in an entire month and both were somewhat my fault or dh s however ds has been in tears multiple times now because he doesn t want to give up wearing his pull ups just yet not because he s scared of an accident per se but just because he likes how they feel more vs a pair of big boy undies so bit of an unusual question but would let a reliably trained little one continue wearing the remainder of his beloved paw patrol pull ups we have about boxes left with the understanding that he d only be wearing them as a substitute for undies and not out of a concern of him having an accident,0,0.47,0.53,0.47,0.47

use ereader or physical books around kids the last few years i have shifted towards doing a lot of my reading on my phone and kindle because it is more convenient and takes up much less space than a personal library also because libby however with two young children in the house i feel that when i am reading my books i should be reading physical copies in order to model behaviors that promote reading and show that not all entertainment is found by staring at a screen background info all of their books are board books and thus physical books and we try to spend time outside when the weather is good i am not trying to steer my children away from tech just trying to find a balance so what have you done in your household and do you feel like it made any difference one way or another,1,0.59,0.41,0.59,0.41000000000000003

on losing interest in your favorite genre i ve been seeing a lot of posts lately where people have been saying that they re starting to get bored tired etc of reading their favorite genre the fact of the matter is that every genre literary fiction included has its tropes and so it makes sense that we get tired of reading them a few years back i was reading exclusively fantasy novels and having finished malazan was left with an indifference to the genre so switched to literary fiction and so saved my enthusiasm for reading i think one think we don t often realize is that the best of books no matter what genre they re written in incorporate elements of other novels just because you re reading literary fiction doesn t mean you won t get romance or fantasy too and just because you re reading fantasy doesn t mean you won t get some thriller or literary fiction i think it s important to switch up our readings and from my experience it s helped me a lot in terms of enjoying and remaining engaged with what i m reading,1,0.99,0.01,0.99,0.010000000000000009

for all the parents with babies please make sure you act accordingly from head trauma hey guys i m a young adult and when i was a baby i fell out of my stroller and hit my head pretty hard when i was checked up by my doctor and did all the scanning on my skull everything seemed fine but i was not given a helmet that can help keep the shape of the head however i currently have a skull depression that goes down the top of my skull it s covered by my hair but one of the effects of this as i was growing especially when i was younger with a small body was that my head was very large the effects of my large head were attributed to the indentation since my head grew in an abnormal way as a result of the trauma so if your baby ever hurts their head make sure you do everything possible to ensure the aesthetics remain stable i ve suffered from moderate depression from my large head size in proportion to my body,0,0.11,0.89,0.11,0.11

toddler has way too many toys yet i m having a hard time donating getting rid of them i grew up poor and sentimental and those that can relate know that this is a huge factor in the seemingly impossible task of donating things growing up poor i cling to things in a weird way now that i am financially comfortable it s still hard to remind myself that i and my family don t face the same struggles that i used to i frequently had to play with old baby toys because i didn t get new ones very often on top of that it s been a tough time reminding myself that my son doesn t even play with these anymore because i spent good money on them the sentimentality factor is tough i want to save them for when he has kids because the majority of what we have is really high quality wooden toys that would make for a great hand me down to his future kids fortunately we own our home and have somewhat decent storage yet our basement is an old canned foods cellar converted into a basement so while we have decent storage it s more for holiday items and my partners tools any advice on how to go about this,0,0.06,0.94,0.06,0.06

you should see me in a crown this was the absolute cutest ya small town romance and so satisfying to finish i loved liz as a protagonist and really connected with her and her anxieties i think the portrayal of her anxiety panic attacks was sensitive but also realistic and i loved being able to see the world through liz s eyes for such a wonderful light and warm book it still manages to highlight some hard hitting issues like racism homophobia long term illness privilege and mental health without at all feeling preachy the relationships between the characters were built up torn down and rebuilt beautifully and i m left finishing this book with a smile on my face it feels nostalgic to be reading about the excitement of prom again the only reason i gave it a instead of star rating is because at times i felt the romance moved a little quickly and i didn t believe it all the time but it s a short ya romance so i m okay with it i would absolutely recommend this book to anyone looking for cute f f ya it s uplifting it s powerful and i d definitely reread it,1,0.9,0.1,0.9,0.09999999999999998

play date turns toxic amongst host amp guest i m am a new father to my first son yo while my friend m has two kids f amp m we haven t seen each other since november he s had a rough past prior to having kids with a dad in and out of prison he s kinda followed his dads footsteps with being aggressive and uses intimidation more so than most mature adults our age his opinions reign supreme and he likes to lay it out what s right and wrong anyways his kids were rough housing together and climbing on furniture and my son copied his daughter to which he disciplined her verbally but all was fine and he assured me my son was fine and he just wanted to get back to us jamming music we once played in a band well my son became tired and hungry and it was around his nap time and as he laid down on the garage floor carpet and wiggled a bit he said my children have never acted like that and reiterated how his kids never whined or had a tantrum which led to him saying that my sons undisciplined and his actions show bc he s been watching him this whole time meanwhile his kids are alone in the house screaming at each other while the older son shows aggression and violently grabs things out of his sister hand this i witnessed and parented on the fly about sharing and how we manage our emotions and treat our sisters etc he insinuated things based off his shallow perception of myself as a stay at home father why don t i wanna work how do i make money i m wasted talent bc i m not famous or playing in a band mind you we two beers which is t enough to spill truth serum he completely assumed my life without ever once asking me respectfully what i do or showing genuine concern and now i m perplexed as to continuing on our friendship or just ignoring his ignorant remarks he said my son doesn t talk he just hears noises from him meanwhile my son knows his full alphabet and pronounced z as zed zed guys knows and recognizes his numbers shapes and colors he s just a bit shy from being isolated through covid and staying in nebraska where it s slim pickings for neighbors with kids there was just sooo much assumed without ever an inquiry of how my sons excelling where did this come from anyone else have envious or ignorant friends who think they re parenting supreme to judge others kids this took me by surprise,0,0.01,0.99,0.01,0.01
i just finished exit west by moshin hamid and wasn t impressed i saw that exit west by moshin hamid was on the new york times top ten for so i decided to give it a go and was left with a meh feeling when it was over maybe it s just me but this magical realism postmodern literature isn t for me hamid does have a great command written english so i give him credit for writing descriptively well and easy to follow i enjoyed the first quarter of the book which lays out the relationship between two lovers saeed and nadia in an unnamed war torn country and their family dynamics i sympathized with the two main characters because of the impending hell that was surrounding them and the tragedies that impacted their city and its residents the story is also sprinkled with little vignettes of people around the world from tokyo the netherlands tijuana and some other city which i can t remember i don t think that helped move the story and i assume it s a postmodern way of telling a story the magic doors in which the characters move from their original city onto greece then to london and then to marin california was magical in that it was a portal to escape from one part of the world and then get transported to the next for some readers this magic may have been compelling but i thought it was bland and the story got repetitive about herds of unwanted refugees from all over the world and how the native population was not welcoming to say the least i will give credit to hamid for adding something new to the old refugee experience story told in a magical realism narrative but it did not work for me thankfully the novel was short and overall i give it a,1,0.87,0.13,0.87,0.13
inverted world by christopher priest has the most disappointing ending i ve ever read spoilers inside i am a tech person and i care about logic and consistency the ending of this book ruins the whole book for me the book describes in great details the strange geometry of the world and effects that this geometry creates the whole story is built around it and what we have at the end it s a massive hallucination no explanation of how different people independently observe the same effects without prior indoctrination no explanation of other inconsistencies nothing if it was one person s night dream it would be quite a dumb ending but it still would be better than this massive hallucination stuff when i was close to the end of the book i suspected that either there would be no explanation or it would be the greatest finale ever couldn t imagine that the book can be ruined so badly,1,0.87,0.13,0.87,0.13

station eleven what an extraordinary book and what an extraordinary time to read it i read emily st john mandel s station eleven yesterday could not put it down cried about a dozen times for context i ve been in iso on and off since march i was a student at a foreign university before covid hit and i had to leave it all behind and come home i ve mostly been alone since and my country is currently in the middle of a terrible third wave this book was so very sad cathartic and beautiful i came of age in the s when post apocalyptic fiction was all the rage but many such works got lost in the spectacle of destruction divergent they did not pay enough attention to the countless tiny unspeakable implications of societal collapse station eleven however depicts an apocalypse a pandemic that kills nearly everyone on earth through the eyes of a handful of people who survived died before or perished during it mandel reflects on the beauty and fragility of the societal structures we take for granted despite tethering our lives and identities to them she shows their devastating collapse makes the case for why surviving isn t enough her characters make and enjoy art they preserve beautiful things for no reason but their beauty they create communities and hold on to their humanness amidst the post apocalyptic desolation during covid i lost time and joy and loved ones this book made me appreciate and want to hold tight to those things and people that still remain,1,0.74,0.26,0.74,0.26

tween refuses to sleep before five in the morning for more than four months before you start reading into this i need to inform you that i am her year old sister and she is years old we live in a house of a neglecting mother and an absent workaholic father there have been no rules that were enforced for longer than three days max in the house ever i recently started living alone and realised that everything i ve known about basically anything basic hygiene cleaning cooking etc was wrong i had to find out pretty much everything by myself so i want to help my sister as much as i can but i m leaving in a month or so though my house is only hours away by bus i m sorry if i m not supposed to this reddit if i made a mistake please feel free to refer me to another one on the main point i ve tried talking over some things with her over and over and though she seemingly agrees at the time she doesn t do any of the things i asked her to do without fail after online school started she slept after two in the morning and soon after the two am became five am i can confirm that because we share a room i ve tried sleep deprivation letting her sleep from six to nine am and then waking her up exercise gradually changing sleeping times but nothing seems to work all it takes is one slip up and all my efforts go to waste a lot of times my mom would intervene too by letting her sleep when she shouldn t ie at noon or sleep until pm even though i managed to make her go to bed at pm that night she also refuses to sleep without anything playing in the bg like the tv or youtube on her phone but i don t think that s a big issue her irl school starts on september nth and i don t know if there is time to fix this there are many other issues i have to help her with as well like her unhealthy eating habits she is obese but if asked to follow a healthy diet she would stop eating altogether or throw up everything she s eaten and over exercise her personal hygiene doesn t brush her teeth or wash her face again because we were never taught or forced to do any of that not even our parents do it it is even hard for me to do so still her messiness and organisation etc but i figured i need to take it one step at a time still if you have any tips for any of those i would be incredibly grateful p s she has visited a psychologist that recently let her go even though i think she still needs it and so does she and she has visited a licensed dietitian before but refused to follow her program she will begin dancing lessons in september which might be helpful,0,0.11,0.89,0.11,0.11

could someone please tell me if there are distinct movements or periods of science fiction writing i m not very well versed with science fiction i think the last proper sci fi book i read was an abridged version of a journey to the centre of the earth by verne that being said i ve been thinking about reading dune by frank herbert as well as some of philip k dick and guin s novels to be perfectly honest i only have vague ideas and no concrete idea of where to begin however that is not what this post is about i want to know if the subgenre of science fiction has distinct categories within it based on when each was produced and the subject matter it deals with for example verne and wells wrote long before herbert and guin is the invisible man then classified under a different label such as classic science fiction and if there is such a thing as classic science fiction pure speculation on my part since i have no idea then what would the sci fi works of the latter half of the th century be classified as i know that this is a confusing question maybe it s irrelevant but i m curious does science fiction like romance and fantasy also have distinct periods for example tolkien was the first to create a high fantasy work of literature right i don t know because i haven t delved into the history of fantasy writing however by popular accounts and the praise of critics it s a fair assumption that tolkien s work can be considered classic fantasy if such a thing exists i have absolutely no idea,1,0.96,0.04,0.96,0.040000000000000036
transitioning a month old to a crib so for some context ever since my daughter was born last august she s always had some unusual sleeping arrangements for the most part she slept for a week in the bassinet before she hated it to which we then moved her to one of those rocking chairs which she ended up hating as well to her car seat attached to the stroller and then now as of december january she s been sleeping with me and my girlfriend for half a year and some change i know that i d probably be judged for that and maybe rightfully so but we always tried to keep her in the one space which clearly didn t work and figured to make our lives and hers easier we d just let her sleep wherever she was the most comfortable while i know im gonna miss snuggling with my daughter at night me and my girlfriend really want to get her into her own space for a multitude of reasons we currently have a crib set up for her and we ve tried putting her in it to sleep with naps but she seems to view it more as a playpen almost than somewhere to actually rest the most use we really get out of it currently is if we re both not in the room and we kinda just need somewhere to stuff her for a minute or two so she doesn t get hurt i know months is probably on the really late side but i would really appreciate some extra tips to try and figure something out,0,0.16,0.84,0.16,0.16

finished the reckoners series by brandon sanderson wow what a ride that was spoilers i really enjoyed the book all the twist and turns i loved the angle of epics using their powers and turning evil but in order for them to overcome it they have to overcome their fears and claim their powers in the end it was calamity just projecting his own fears in epics david had was a good character he was hell bent on revenge and by the end he only fought for his father dreams that good epics will come eventually and help humanity how he was a foot solider that the reckoners didn t really trust to running point to leading the reckoners against prof the slight teasing of him becoming an epic in the second book to fully embracing it at the end of the third i also loved how he found closure in the end with his father from a different realm dimension and his father being steelheart in that realm dimension and teaching him how to use his new powers i found prof storyline to be tragic and sad trying so long not to become the very thing he was fighting in the end killing his own team and causing the death of his love tia regalia was pure evil and a genius on how she laid out her plan to make prof her successor ohh the part where he popped in and punched calamity square in the face in the glass space station was amazing i did not expect that at all cody honestly was my favourite character he was overall a hilarious addition to the team with his wacky stories all in all i loved this series,1,0.97,0.03,0.97,0.030000000000000027

oliver twist oliver twist is very early dickens i think only his second novel but everyone will recognize here all the elements familiar to readers of dickens the long complex sentences the mystery child the sentimentality and gt the happy ending that is marred by an unexpected death lt taken to an extreme and dickens loved to take things to extremes they are faults but i still think oliver twist is one of his best novels one of the best things about it is the consistent theme on almost every page we are aware that we are reading brilliant social commentary victorian england must have been hell for poor people especially children and dickens brings this to life better than anyone his criminals sound like real criminals and are convincing even by contemporary standards some of dickens other novels tend to be all over the place dickens himself and most critics consider david copperfield the better novel but i found that to be a collection of amusing anecdotes rather than a tight novel like ot so i prefer ot ot is also dickens darkest novel almost gothic horror the descriptions of gt nancy s murder bill sikes s death and his dog s and fagin in the dock are not only graphic but among the best writing dickens ever did lt maybe because it is only his second novel the style is a little rough dickens hasn t yet learned to make those long sentences flow or to smooth out his ironic tone with the rest of the straightforward narrative the worst part is the racism people warned dickens at the time the book was racist but he just ignored them and it is a major distraction but he also has this weird respect and even fascination with fagin bill sikes is portrayed as an animal but fagin is a complex character and we get a detailed description of his mental state at the end that we didn t get with bill downvote for sentimentality the love story is bad enough but there is gt oliver s friend dick at the beginning of the story we almost never hear about again and then almost on the last page we learn he is dead we didn t need to know lt but it s still a good book,1,0.95,0.05,0.95,0.050000000000000044
the star wars prequel trilogy and romeo amp juliet are hated for the same dumb reason okay here me out i know this may seem a little ridiculous but i ve been thinking back to criticisms i ve heard of r amp j the play and they sound eerily similar to criticisms i ve heard about the prequels people hate r amp j and the prequels because the two love interests are dumb and annoying ignoring the fact that their literal children teenagers also ignoring that the fact that they are children teenagers plays into the wider tragedy and overall messages of the stories people hyper focus on the cheesier elements of the two stories the love talk in r amp j and the dialogue in the prequels people will dismiss r amp j as shallow for the previously mentioned elements while missing that the entire point of the play is that the blood feud between the two houses literally cost them their children people will dismiss the prequels for the previously mentioned elements while missing that the entire point of the story is political rot and overly strict orthodoxy leading to the rise of a dictatorship what do you guys think is the comparison apt or is the above image an accurate representation of the post,1,0.55,0.45,0.55,0.44999999999999996

reading don dellilo am i missing something i have been reading mao ii recently but unfortunately i haven t really managed to get into it i just don t get what it s saying both at the surface level and the subtextual level i m assuming there is some deep meaning to it which is cool but if i can t even get invested in the storyline or the characters on a surface level it sort of seems pointless to read it especially if i am not really enjoying it i have read white noise already which although i somewhat enjoyed it struggled to really get it am i just not intellectually or emotionally ready for delillo s style of story telling yet or something i really want to be able to appreciate him as i know he is revered as one of the best novelists of american society of the late twentieth century and all that also i want to read thomas pynchon but i am concerned he will be too similar to dellilo is this true or do they actually have different styles,1,0.83,0.17,0.83,0.17000000000000004
unpopular opinion reading a book in one sitting is not necessarily a sign of its quality unpopular opinion reading a book in one sitting is not necessarily a sign of its quality it can simply mean that an author is very good at establishing and mainting tension sometimes such books heavily prioritise destination over journey and have weaker characters the re readability might also suffer an example of the last book i read in a day was the girl with all the gifts by ma carey while it had very interesting worldbuilding at the beginning it turned into a not that interesting road trip i still finished it though because i hoped the scientists were gonna find a cure for the zombie apocalypse now that i know how the book ends i see no reason to read the book again dont get me wrong the book wasnt bad merely not great imo,1,0.97,0.03,0.97,0.030000000000000027

slaughter house narrated by ethan hawke just finished listening to the audio book of vonneguts ww dresden bombing exploration slaughter house narrated by ethan hawke and loved it i vaguely remember trying to read vonnegut a long time ago it might have been this book and really struggled with it hawkes soothing interesting voice is great to listen to and gave me a way into vonneguts sometimes dense prose and surreal flights of fancy it also took a bit of the edge of some of the distrurbing subject matter listening in the car worked extremely well as it broke it up into my driving sessions giving me time to mull it over and not be overwhelmed plus there is a really trance like quality to hawke s narration that worked so well for driving i was able to just flow with vonneguts often strange stories and bizzare imagery and ride it like waves it was an abridged version so i might go back and read the full book at some point he is a fascinating writer with a real vision and wonderful sense of poignant absurdity that goes deep and sprinkled with dark humour as if you should never take this crazy existence thing too seriously but never skipping over how painful and brutal it does get it is a bit of a slaughterhouse but so it goes,1,0.86,0.14,0.86,0.14

review something in the water catherine steadman spoilers i just finished something in the water by catherine steadman and sorry but i m mad at how bad it was so buckle up for the bashing of this turd fire of a novel there will be heavy spoilers oh man where to begin erin this girl really is the dumbest person alive almost every decision she made had me wanting to scream at her for someone who makes documentaries for a living i struggle to believe she s never seen a true crime doc the digital trail she leaves is incredible it s like she s trying to get caught i kept waiting for it to come back in on her and still don t understand how it doesn t in the end does the author just not understand how police work by the end of the novel the author is really trying to sell the idea that erin is able to get away with mark s disappearance after googling how guns work and watching a bunch of videos on how to clean and load a glock literally the day before leaving town and days before he goes missing come on everyone knows the spouse is suspect number one when someone goes missing we re supposed to believe the london police wouldn t pull her digital forensics and find that immediately she obviously just went on an out of the ordinary trip by herself made a giant commotion with the glass shot a bunch of holes in a tree and mark is buried like mins from there they re not going to find that they aren t going to see all the spots mark and the plane guy were digging up or blood where mark and patrick were killed she has an obvious head injury the day she s calling the police and reporting him missing none of the officers speaking to her are going to notice that no one heard her scuffle with patrick in the hotel no one saw simon a known mob associate at her house twice no one takes interest in her connection to eddie she not only had the regular police involved she also has an anti terrorism detective interested you re telling me this woman who we ve been following and seeing making multiple mistakes over the course of the novel is able to out maneuver them all while being heavily questioned it s just bad writing i obviously could include more here but i think you get it mark how did she not get creep vibes from him right away i sure did i was convinced he was involved pretty early on it was obvious he was maneuvering her i just don t understand his motivation ok so he s broke and suddenly they have money why would that make him turn on his brand new wife and hire a guy to stalk and beat her up i kept thinking he was somehow connected to the plane people she was sleeping on the boat when he happened upon the case he was the only one who saw the inside of the plane he hired patrick to follow her he was manipulating the situation so she would be the one on camera and paper trails it would have made more sense interesting the author kills him off before he can explain his motivations to erin even though she s literally leaning over his body as he dies why wouldn t she fucking ask him it s like the author couldn t make his motivations make sense so she chose not to explain it also why wouldn t mark have patrick spot him when the russian showed up you can hire him to slap around your wife but not to cover you from the tree line while you meet up with this dude it s never explained who patrick was to mark how did he find him why did he trust him with handling erin and not talking or extorting him why didn t patrick attack erin when she was sleeping instead of giving her the chance to get the upper hand on him did he really not notice there was a giant window in the bathroom she could easily break out of since when does a shower drown out tye sound of a giant window shattering all over a tiled floor plot why doesn t the author ever say who the plane people are so much of the plot focuses on this and it never becomes anything almost all of erin s idiotic mistakes are because she s so curious who these people are and then we never even find out we never get the answer to what mark saw in the plane that made him so sure they were bad people and never find out what is so valuable on the usb we never even find out how much of a threat they really are erin senses herself being watched but it s pretty much explained that was patrick so how worried should she be about these people the guy who kills mark just disappears without a trace maybe killing patrick maybe not and what he just stops he blatantly tells mark the plane coordinates are part of the deal hell that s why he kills mark in the first place but he just decides to leave erin alone right that s definitely a thing russian mobsters do and after killing mark he doesn t want the million he just transferred to mark s account back he all of a sudden stops caring about the plane he obviously knows erin knows where it was and that he was texting with two different people when erin was arranging the drop he s just not going to follow up on that would this guy have even ever found them if erin just stopped turning on the freaking phone like how powerful are we supposed to think this guy is he wasn t in her house he wasn t following her she was the one who had to arrange the meeting how did erin and mark even get the diamonds and cash back in the first place it s million in cash and another million in diamonds customs isn t going to notice that in the luggage scanner idk how things work in england but they get a connecting flight through the us where you have to declare anything over k they flew from bora bora to la to new york to london none of

kid is still a crappy sleeper at what s the outlook here my kid has always been a rubbish sleeper from having colic in the early months to only having slept through the night maybe twice in his years of life our current situation is that i lie with him at bedtime until he goes to sleep takes about minutes and he s usually asleep by around he wakes up and comes into my bed usually goes back to sleep without me having to do anything but then from around am til am he s incredibly restless and half awake he rolls around the bed a lot crams himself up against me tries to hold my hand sometimes tries to lie on top of me sometimes asks me to pay his back this doesn t happen every night but probably of nights around he falls into a deep sleep again and sleeps until some time between and i have no problem with him coming in to my bed the problem is the disrupted sleep from to which is having a major impact on my ability to not be a grumpy snarling grouch during the day i m interested in hearing from parents of similar kids who are now older did things improve did it happen naturally or did you have to make interventions is this my fault for lying with him at bedtime and could it be a symptom of a sensory processing disorder,0,0.07,0.93,0.07,0.07

stephen king s on writing a memoir on myself the only thing i knew about this book is that stephen king once wrote a book about the craft of writing called on writing yes i m belaboring the obvious for a reason the first half is an autobiography of his childhood up to the s and the second half is what i wanted to read about writing it was interesting to read a true story of an average guy from humble beginnings doing various jobs before striking it big and boy did he get a mega deal with carrie his first book i just wish the title of the book was something like my life and craft because i wouldn t have been confused by the original title anyway the talk about how to write was disappointing i should note i do write fiction so i am familiar with the basics already mr king states the talking points you can find in any workshop class on how to write don t use passive voice destroy adverbs skip the boring parts make characters realistic i wanted something unique about the man who has sold million books its a decent read for anyone curious about his past with addiction and how he met his wife but as far writing tips skip,1,0.89,0.11,0.89,0.10999999999999999

do you encourage or push friendships on your children that they aren t interested in i have children including a year old daughter recently my cousin who had six children became our neighbor in a rural area living so far out it was exciting that our kids could now have playmates so close the eldest of their children is also a year old girl but age and gender seem to be the o my things she and my daughter have in common their children are homeschooled by mom in a home without a tv and internet and they have very traditional and conservative beliefs our home is unusual my husband and myself run a business together from our property and often travel and our kids are involved in sports and activities at school i feel like most kids their age much of their interests are rooted in video games tv shows and the internet but they have healthy social lives with kids their own age in person as well my youngest is and has developed a friendship with the cousin s daughter around the same age because much of their time is still focused on imaginative play and outdoor activities but cousin is frustrated that my year old often turns down invitations to spend time with her daughter i know it is because my daughter finds it difficult to carry on a conversation with the other girl and doesn t know what to do when their together because they are limited on what the other girl s parents find as appropriate activities but i also feel like they are isolating their daughter at home with her younger siblings often making her a caretaker for them and not getting her involved with activities outside their home my cousin recently told me that my daughter is being short sighted by not making an effort to be friends with their daughter and i don t know how to respond with the friendships my daughter does have she maintains them on her own and makes plans with her friends over the phone cousin s daughter doesn t communicate with my daughter at all and has the parents ask to make plans for her i also feel like it s putting a lot on a year old to call them short sighted for who get choose to be friends with my daughter has never been unkind or hurtful to the other girl she just says she wants to stay home when she s invited to come over and play with the other girl i feel like that s my daughter s choice to make but am i wrong am i allowing my child to be unfair and hurtful how much do you push your child to be friends with someone especially as they get older,0,0.04,0.96,0.04,0.04

my mid year book review what should i read next i made it a goal of mine this year to actually read consistently throughout the year i wanted to share what i ve read so far and my thoughts on a couple books that stood out to me as well as ask anyone for recommendations based on what i ve read here is the list the man who mistook his wife for a hat by oliver sacks a brief history of time by stephen hawking the actual by saul bellow emperor of all maladies by siddhartha mukherjee the stranger by albert camus things fall apart by chinua achebe american art since a critical history by barbara rose origins of life by freeman dyson the electric kool aid acid test by tom wolfe jews don t count by david baddiel importance of being earnest by oscar wilde yitzhak rabin soldier leader statesman by itamar rabinovich everything in its place first loves and last tales by oliver sacks other minds the octopus the sea and the deep origins of consciousness by peter godfrey smith dragons of eden speculations on the evolution of human intelligence by carl sagan why nations fail by daron acemoglu and james a robinson philosophy of andy warhol by andy warhol a promised land by barack obama and the band played on politics people and the aids epidemic by randy shilts currently cannery row by john steinbeck favorites why nations fail say what you will about the theory the authors present but as a whole this is one of the most well researched and thorough non fiction books i ve ever read it takes you throughout the globe exploring the history of the political and economic institutions found in countries like china botswana somalia colombia and france among many others condensing an enormous amount of information into a fascinating and easily digestible story about why the world is the way it is today highly recommend this for any history econ polisci nerds out there a promised land for the same reason as why nations fail i really enjoyed this book for how loaded it is with the history of the obama administration s first term regardless of your political leanings i recommend this book to get a better picture of what exactly he did and did not accomplish in his first term and the reasoning behind his choices surprisingly it was also quiet a fascinating look at the former president as well as you get some really interesting peaks into his personal life excellent book for people interested in modern politics or just looking for a great biography emperor of all maladies perhaps my favorite book of the year presented as a biography of cancer oncologist siddhartha mukherjee not only tracks the accumulation of knowledge about cancer throughout the centuries but also dives into the lives of some of his patients it truly feels like a thorough dive into what cancer is and how we got to where we are today without feeling too jargon heavy albeit i may be biased i m a science major while also touching on some fascinating moments in american medical history including the rush for the polio vaccine and the aids epidemic the man who mistook his wife for a hat i ll start off by saying that oliver sacks is perhaps one of my biggest heroes i ve read several of his books and basically all of his articles that i could find i even credit him for almost single handedly pushing me towards becoming a neurologist given this it s hard not to be a bit biased when talking about his most famous book but i ll try what i believe makes oliver sacks so unique as both a doctor and an author is the way he is able to weave both the scientific aspect of a brain disorder together with the actual humanity of the patient to give you a real glimpse into the rich lives of the people he comes across his books are never too scientific nor too heavy on the soppy stuff it s always a perfect mix of both that allows the reader a rare glimpse into our own brains this book is full of some of his most strange and oddly touching cases and features some of his most hard hitting questions for his audience to consider highly highly recommend this book honorable mentions jews don t count is a great look into subtle antisemitism found in modern politics social media and journalism it s well written and quite disturbing i also really enjoyed the electric kool aid acid test which was not only really well written it features a lot of colorful language and near poetic prose to give you a glimpse into what acid trips are actually like which is pretty cool but it s also quite a thrilling look into the flower power movement and its notable characters it s a cool journey into a fun and strangely thought provoking chapter of american life to those of you who have read these books what were your thoughts and what else would you recommend me to read,1,0.92,0.08,0.92,0.07999999999999996

ready player one woke me up early to read i saw the movie awhile back but hadn t remembered much i came across the book for at ollie s and decided to pick it up it s been keeping me up at night and waking me up early in the morning to read it s really a great and unique story that being said some of the writing feels a bit lazy to me for example gt when wade is placed as an indent in the ioi tech center there are some really great descriptive chapters reminiscent of then all of a sudden he states that he did some sabotage earlier which allowed him to turn off the security cameras how when lt just felt like there were some gaps throughout the book but nonetheless i thoroughly enjoyed it i have to imagine this might be a leading factor to some of the less than stellar reviews for ready player two,1,0.73,0.27,0.73,0.27

teaching kids to look before crossing the street anybody have any tips i have a ten year old and he just doesn t get it at all we ve been struggling with it for years and he pretty much never turns his head before strolling into a street now he has basketball practice about a half mile from our house we only have one car my spouse usually has it at work so the easiest way for him to get there is to walk i work from home but i can t always walk with him we want him to walk by himself it s a safe neighborhood and kids his age being out and about alone is totally normal here northern europe but he just never looks before crossing the street today i walked with him and there are about five or six small streets he has to cross he didn t look a single time in fact he kept bouncing his basketball and lost it into the main street twice both times he darted out without a glance for cars when we are out i tell him every single time to look i make him go back when he doesn t he s just so absent minded that it doesn t seem to have sunk in even a little if i don t tell him he maybe looks of the time it s a shame because he s at an age when we d love for him to be able to do some basic things alone but he just can t he s going to miss a lot of basketball practices because i don t feel it s safe for him to go alone any longer does anybody have any suggestions on how help him i m thinking about walking behind him to practice when i m available and telling him he can go alone when he can show me three times in a row he can go there and back without a single mistake and then maybe taking him to a secluded street to practice over and over until it becomes habit until then he ll miss practice if i can t take him or maybe i expecting too much for a ten year old,0,0.12,0.88,0.12,0.12

y o suddenly acting out help please this started earlier this year before her th birthday she would say meaningless but more rude things like i hate mummy and when we acted shocked and asked her what she meant she would giggle and smile and my partner would say are you playing a trick on us and she would say yes we didn t think anything of it she s and she s exploring her boundaries and what she can and can t get away with etc but recently this behaviour has just worsened her school reports all state that she is extremely well behaved quite shy and has excellent manners at home however she s been losing her temper easily sometimes yelling at us and demanding things instead of asking like she used to yesterday she yelled at me while when we took her out on a nature trail because i told her to wait to go find more berries i gave her a stern look and said are you yelling at me which usually leads to her backing down and then communicating normally but this time she yelled again and when i tried to explain why we had to wait she covered her ears and i just walked away from her we were babysitting a friend s toddler and y o today she was playing around with me and my partner and she tried to smack my bum but hit my back hard instead i explained that you have to look where your smacking someone and not do it too hard because you don t want to hurt people she proceeded to the same thing and i said that really hurt and she just kept laughing as soon as my partner tried to explain to her about hurting others and respect she started crying and yelling stop talking to me my partner sent her upstairs not as punishment just to give her some time to cool off when my partner went up to talk to her about it again she was upset and just kept asking for her lost favourite plushie she s also been more emotional as of late like crying when she s hungry and her dinner is on crying when she s thirsty instead of just asking for a drink and if we have kids her age over and they touch her things she ll just start sobbing crying and screaming before even coming to us to ask for help does anyone have any tips on how to allow her to explore her boundaries while reinforcing that yelling saying mean things and acting out isn t acceptable i want her to know that her emotions are always valid and she is allowed to get frustrated upset and angry and if us as parents are doing something that she feels is unfair i definitely want her to speak her mind but in a respectful way if that make sense i also want to ensure she feels basic empathy like when she hurts someone she feels bad about it and apologises but she hates apologising and often cries and refuses to talk when she is told to apologise she s always been a cheeky child but i m at a loss here,0,0.04,0.96,0.04,0.04

how to explain certain differences regarding gender to young children sorry this is gonna be long i grew up in a very conservative community and we still live in a small town that doesn t see much diversity my children are kindergarten age and are at phase where they are trying to figure out people and relationships i ve had a couple of instances that i wish i had a better response reaction prepared there is a man my husband works with who identifies as male but does have traits that are seen as traditionally feminine and has a higher pitched voice no idea if he s born male or trans but know he often dresses as both genders when not at work well we went to visit husband at work and he was talking to this man when we walked up he was wearing gender neutral clothes like a t shirt and jeans or something he was very nice to my kids joking with them and such then out of nowhere my kid asks are you a boy or a girl he seemed a little annoyed but answered that he was boy and my kid said ok and the conversation moved on i heard all of this second hand because i had stepped away to use the bathroom when this happened my husband was mortified i get it though i ve wondered before myself but as an adult i know not to voice such a question my kid didn t we had another incident at a nail salon where one of the ladies was wearing long shorts and t shirt no makeup and had her hair cut very short and buzzed on the side my other kid asked her the same question about being a boy or a girl she didn t answer at first and so my kid kept asking she too was a little annoyed but finally answered that she was a girl i did not hear this one personally either my mother did my mother is very conservative she shrugged it off and said well she shouldn t dress like that if she doesn t want people to wonder i told my mom that she has every right to dress however she wants and mom should have told my kid to quit asking when it obviously made the lady uncomfortable i ve now told my children that it s not polite to ask personal questions like that citing these specific instances but kiddo said but we didn t know if they were boys or girls we wanted to know and i get that this is part of their desire to know and understand about people so i told them if they had a question like that then they needed to ask me quietly and i would do my best to answer them had to have the same discussion about asking if a lady had a baby in her belly too fortunately she is actually pregnant or that convo would have been super fun too lol but having grown up in a conservative household i have no experience explaining these type things to children so far i ve just explained that clothes are just clothes there s no law that says certain clothes or haircuts for that matter are just for one gender and that people are free to express themselves how they want and that peoples bodies are different too so a girl could have a deep voice and a boy could have a high voice and boy could be more graceful like a dancer when he walks and a girl might not only way i could think to explain gait patterns and movements to children and so we may not always be able to know immediately just by looking if someone is a boy or girl they go to a private school with a strict dress code so in their little world boys look like boys and girls look like girls so they re having trouble wrapping their heads around why someone doesn t always look like what they expect a boy or girl to look like i don t want them to grow up like i did being told that anyone different was weird so i want to get this right if someone has any better ideas for helping them understand i d appreciate it,0,0.16,0.84,0.16,0.16
my kid had something stuck in her esophagus and i wanted to share so my year old had something stuck in esophagus and i wanted to share for anyone else since it was stressful not knowing exactly what to do my kid had an upset stomach and asked if she could take one of my tums they are pretty large but she has a few times taken one here or there in the past without issue my kid walked out of the room with it and saw their teenage sibling my kid mentioned that they don t like the taste of most tums and the teenager suggested she swallow it like a pill well the younger one did and ran into me saying they were choking they have choked before on an ice cube so knew what it felt like yet they could talk so i knew they weren t fully choking they asked for the heimlich but i told them no since they could talk amp x b they swore it was in their throat and the rest of the family swore they were exaggerating since they were talking and crying saying it hurt and it s still in there and it hurt to swallow yet i know it can be stuck further down my kid didn t want to go to a doctor yet and i was on the fence so i tried hot tea then soda after much complaining and their stomach already upset from earlier and now the events unfolding over the last minutes or so they finally threw up i wasn t sure what would happen if they tried to puke and something is stuck in their esophagus would it work like a cork well that s an exaggeration but could it damage their esophagus immediately after throwing up my kid said they felt much better and the object was gone checking the bucket an intact tum was sitting in the bottom when i dumped it out into the toilet amp x b the fact that they said that they know now it s out after puking confirms that it was indeed stuck and the fact i found it intact makes that believable they also added after the fact that it hurt in their throat to turn their head before they puked which would have been good to know so yes things can get stuck but puking is a way to solve it depending on what is stuck i think eating butter or drinking some soda if possible will help otherwise if they swear it s in there i suggest you get them checked out by a doctor sooner than later even if they are breathing fine,0,0.13,0.87,0.13,0.13

integrity honesty with teens hoping for a little insight here my year old boy has been having lots of issues with online porn it s borderline if not an actual addiction at this point we ve tried locking down devices but he s been able to defeat all of our attempts we even have basically taken away his rights to internet capable devices entirely but then he just steals one of our laptops or a sibling s tablet and hides it besides just the issue of porn being damaging to his future relationships and i ve seen the search history this isn t the equivalent of finding dad s playboy it s pretty bad stuff it s causing problems with his sleep patterns plus he s lying so much that we can t really believe almost anything he tells us last episode he took my wife s laptop and hid it in his room for a couple days we had a talk about his sleep issues because he had nearly missed a drivers ed driving lesson because he had gone off to hide for a nap and we couldn t find him for quite a while i asked if was staying up all night on a computer and even promised he d not be punished at all if he fessed up he was emphatic he had nothing that he just had a really good book next day my wife was in a panic because she couldn t find her laptop and needed it for a report that was due for minutes even with another amnesty offer he chose to say nothing i finally dug deep enough in his room and found it apparently his embarrassment over being caught was more important than his mom s panicked need to locate it even with a promise of no punishment if he was honest about taking it we re working on getting him to a counselor therapist but there s a wait list right now for the good ones he s on restriction grounded as a result of the lying and will be doing tons of chores beyond the normal expectations and his room will be gutted and he ll only have a fairy minimal amount of stuff so it s harder to hide things we re also going to get him on an exercise regime not as punishment but so he s ready for fall sports and also in the hope that more activity will help him with better sleep habits and focus his mind but what else can we do to help him,0,0.1,0.9,0.1,0.1

is not truer than ever i read recently there are two things i do not like when people discuss this book no it s not truer than ever do you really think a thousand years ago or heck years ago people were freer than now people can read listen watch whatever they want without any repercussions this was not the case not long ago while some of the things in are similar to now media manipulation for instance or using manipulative language pretty much all of these things were true in the past it s not anything new it supports the lazy narrative that it s all government s fault i really dislike the view that everything is the government s fault and governments are all these evil satans whose only purpose is manipulation that s just lazy thinking while governments are not perfect and often incompetent bureaucratic the idea that boris johnson would want to keep everyone in fear a view shared by a phd student at a top university when discussing the pandemic restrictions is silly the book furthers gives a talking point to these types of thinking note i am not saying the book intentionally does this or that s the book s aim i am simply disagreeing with the interpretation many people have note i am talking about the west here mostly obviously in north korea people are not particularly free i would still bet they are more free than a few hundred years ago though,1,0.79,0.21,0.79,0.20999999999999996

every year chan ranks their best books of all time i compiled every list they ve ever released to create the ultimate chan greatest books of all time here it is oc this took like hours of mind numbing grunt work so i really hope some of you enjoy it it s a really rather interesting list and it s always fascinated me how despite chan s reputation whenever their book lists come out each year they are always well respected and spark meaningful discussion there are definitely biases here and i ll touch on some of those but for now here s the list uncompressed postimg link imgur link compressed notes they ve only released lists thus far starting in and ending in with one year having two official list releases i put this data together months ago so i m a bit hazy on the reason but one of those two lists seemed to make far more sense to me at the time as the true list so i just chose that one and disregarded the alternate list i hope the intro is understandable but in case it s confusing if a book appeared in at least of yearly lists it is not penalized lowered in rank for not appearing in the other or but books with or less appearances are always ranked lower than books that appeared on more of the lists even if they ranked higher on average the number may seem arbitrary but i had to have some system to avoid outliers and that made the most sense to me books by american authors appear more than twice as often as any other nationality with occurrences then english with russian with french with and irish with books are from europe and there are none from either asia or africa besides the bible nearly half of the russian novels appear in the top though their five novels in the top fall just short of the american novels in the top chan validates its reputation somewhat as the list only features three female authors one being jk rowling notable authors like jane austen and mary shelley are absent virginia woolf does have two submissions though authors have multiple appearances the most appearances made by any author is a three way tie between doestoevsky joyce and pynchon with kafka and faulkner have by far the most popular century is the th century with occurrences the next highest th has under the oldest book is the bible and the newest is jerusalem by alan moore there are books from bc the average submission including series is pages the lowest page counts belong to kafka s the metamorphosis with and hamlet with and the most are the harry potter series with and proust s in search of lost time with the most common subgenres besides literary fiction are philosophical fiction with postmodernist fiction with and science fiction with appearances despite believing fully that they themselves are hilarious only one comedy appears on the list,1,0.88,0.12,0.88,0.12

i m a little on edge we re doing potty training which is just great we re to the point where he tells me he has to go which is actually great except he seems resistant to the idea of pooping in the toilet there have been several days where he tells me he has to go and he goes and minutes later there s that smelly smell that smells smelly wafting my way while we re back in the living room i ve explained to him over and over and over again that poop goes in the potty not in his underwear but it just seems like day after day the lesson just bounces off his ears i tried to discipline him by taking the tablet away because he was usually in such a rush to get back to the tablet that he sped through peeing and didn t poop i tried making him sit on the toilet when i thought he needed to poop but that didn t work either my times seem to be off the smells coming out of him seem to indicate imminent arrival of poop but it doesn t actually show until hours later so i don t know what to do aside from laundry every single day because we ve got wet underwear and underwear that was pooped in pretty sure my house smells slightly like a public restroom at this point,0,0.27,0.73,0.27,0.27

my daughter called herself stupid and i agreed please read the post before you judge my daughter is and a very confident stubborn beautiful smart and charming little girl whenever she makes a mistake or misbehaves she calls herself stupid until now i have told her with emphasis and love that she is not stupid when she does this that it was a stupid thing to do but that she herself is not stupid it does not seem to work mean anything help her feel better last week my son did the same because he had forgotten to feed our pet rabbit i fed it don t worry he was feeling really bummed over this and said i feel so stupid i answered we all feel that sometimes and then we just started laughing so hard because of course i meant that we all sometimes feel stupid and not that we all sometimes feel that he is stupid but somehow it lifted his mood and improved the whole situation to laugh about it i decided to try something similar on my daughter yesterday she called herself stupid and i looked at her with a smile and said yes wow you really are crazy stupid i actually used a more offending term in our native language but i can t find anything that fits in english so this will have to do she looked at me in shock and i added i am too sometimes she smiled i continued you are also smart brave and very kind sometimes you are stupid even dumb actually she laughed and sometimes you are beautiful ugly funny angry happy sad sleepy scared and no matter what you are i love you very much all the time at this point she was snuggling in my arms and looked very happy we talked a little more about how much i loved her and she came up with a lot of both serious and ridiculous examples like what if she was very small or very big or if she had giant feet or no hair at all or what if she had done something very bad i confirmed that i loved her and would love her no matter what it was just so lovely to see how much better this approach worked embracing her mistakes and flaws and making her feel loved anyway just made her so happy it was really nice to be able to reassure her this way,0,0.27,0.73,0.27,0.27
we should stop saying war and peace is hard to read this may be premature given that i m lt of the way through the book but it s honestly not the incredibly taxing read i d been expecting here are the actual challenges of the book that i ve noticed thus far yeah it s definitely long lots of russian names including multiple titles and nicknames for individual characters though i hear this is standard for tolstoy some tricky vocab but i ve read waay more overly complicated wording in other texts aside from those possible barriers for your typical reader i ve been seriously enjoying it the characterization and setting descriptions are lovely the political and historical context of the book is also intriguing there s plenty of quality royal bickering which makes it feel like high brow soap opera so yeah it s not as scary as i d thought it d be what do y all think,1,0.86,0.14,0.86,0.14

finished matt haig s the midnight library fashionably late but i just want to get my thoughts out there there s a piece of writing advice from trey parker and matt stone the south park guys that really stuck with me to paraphrase the words between plot beats should either be therefore or but if you have and then between plot beats you got a problem i found that the midnight library had a problem the plot very is mostly just and then stretching on for the entire story that s kind of challenging to avoid in a story about hopping between lives and universes like this but it doesn t really try to string it s events together in a strong way the decisions that are given to nora are very limited it basically amounts to pick a life universe to enter live in it a while to see what s up then stumble across a piece of information that nopes her right back to the library the potential for agency and interesting choices feels unnecessarily squashed the book would have worked much better had it been written more like an anthology use fewer universes make each one a distinct short story in their own right with their own nora as a protagonist that would also create great opportunities to play around with plot structure point of view genre and style and make the and then nature of the overall story more palatable alternatively i would have liked to seen the metaplot strengthened build up the midnight library itself as an interesting setting gt explore what the other multiverse travelers are like lt and lean into the quantum physics angle create conflict beyond the library will collapse eventually when convenient for the plot this approach would run the risk of losing sight of themes especially in a book this short but if successfully written could create an interesting little sci fi adventure as it is i mostly just found the story to be a very dry series of events with little tension and few concepts that really caught my interest that s my big issue with the book i found the protagonist to have a rushed backstory that mostly exists to tee up the multiverse scenarios and as a character was mostly a collection of millennial anxieties i say as a millennial with similar anxieties and i was uncomfortable with she used the body of an alternate universe version of herself for sex if i d been hijacked by my multiverse double and was used like that i d be disturbed that said i didn t dislike the book surprising myself i found the ending really stuck and inspired me to look at my own life there are many many stories that i ve enjoyed significantly more that haven t done this mostly i just wish i had checked this book out at my library instead of impulse buying it the midnight library is a book with a good heart a dry soul and a scattered brain one little unrelated note to end things on i love that the book is dedicated to health workers and care workers lots of respect points to matt haig for that,1,0.84,0.16,0.84,0.16000000000000003

my year old daughter has been taking in appropriate pictures of herself hi all i feel physically sick at what i ve found on my daughters phone today a few months ago i had found screenshots she had taken of naked ladies peeing on her tablet she had taken a lot and seemed to be interested in ladies weeing for some reason we had a big talk about it and that it s inappropriate for her to be looking at stuff like this and the dangers of the internet etc etc today i checked her phone and noticed photos on the recently deleted file in her gallery so i clicked on it and almost had a heart attack she has deleted multiple images of naked ladies peeing squirting but has also taken very intimate and pretty much pornogrpahic images of herself including a video of her fondling her own breats and another video of her pouring water down the foent of her pants she seems to have an obsession with urinating i ve spoken to her about it again and told her how dangerous and inappropriate it is for her to be doing this i made sure she knew she was loved and i didn t shout at her but i just kept explaining how wrong this was for her to do and that it s not appropriate for children and it can be really dangerous we ve already spoken a million times about internet safety and stuff but i m just so shocked about this i told her it could also get me in a lot of trouble if i was found to have those picture sin my house because its illegal she is banned from the phone and tablet for the foreseeable future and has been told if she s allowed on them again they are only to be used downstairs and never taken upstairs she also has to keep her bedroom door open all the time i just don t know what to think or do or even if i ve handled it ok i don t want her to clam up and feel like she can t talk to me and i ve encouraged her to talk to me about anything and have told her i understand she is just curious but that she needs to learn through appropriate ways and not through pirnography does anyone have any advice or has been through this themselves she is very developed for years old and i m fully expecting her to start her periods at any time now so i know hormones are probably playing a huge part but how do i speak to her about it without embarrassing her or making her feel ashamed she hasn t said a word to me at all since i ve spoken to her the whole time she just sat with her head down sorry for any typos my hands are shaking and i m still in shock after finding those pictures i ve even got a bottle of wine to drink to calm my nerves and i m not usually a drinker but i just don t even know what to think,0,0.09,0.91,0.09,0.09

the best book for students to read is in my opinion utilitarianism by john stuart mill this book explains the foundation of morality it explains what all of our actions should strive for all that motivates us is pain and pleasure the book would give the students meaning and purpose and it would teach them about how to care about others the philosophy of utilitarianism is great for debates students that dislike school could argue that schools do not maximize utility etc,1,0.56,0.44,0.56,0.43999999999999995

just finished the years of rice and salt from kim stanley robinson i personally found this book to be a thrilling read for a basic idea of the plot instead of the actual death toll the black death caused in our timeline in this timeline the black death kills pretty much all of europe which in turn leads to the world developing around the muslim world and china and eventually other nations come into the scene too kim has done an excellent job of highlighting the details of this world and their version of our events their politics changes in religious thought and etc however a large portion of the book involves the concept of reincarnation and a jati this is basically a group of souls trying to break the dharmic wheel by living through numerous reincarnated lifetimes though the culture and times these characters are born into change they all share the same first letter of their name so it s easy to keep track on who s who i find the reincarnation concept to be very romantic as there are portions where the souls either in their earthly life or in the in between before they are reincarnated reminisce about their past lives what they did wrong what they hope for the future and a promise that they will see each other again in the next reincarnation these characters throughout the book in the progressing times do find each other and impact each other s lives and the world around them from a portion of the book in another life to a better time this is reinforced in the end but i won t spoil it for you guys i m a huge sucker for these type of themes in a book i highly recommend giving this book a read only negative is that halfway it gets kinda boring but it picks up again i m definitely looking for to kim s other works now,1,0.9,0.1,0.9,0.09999999999999998

trying to find a book using its plot please help hi there my mum knows i love reading books and she told me about this book she read in her syllabus when she was in but she can t remember the title and i cannot find the book i even tracked down syllabuses and such to try find it she said it was a relatively short story the plot in the most simple terms goes like this the setting is train train station and a man tracks down a woman who happens to be the woman who killed his wife and daughter in a car accident of some sort anyways she can t remember what happens in the middle but towards the end they talk and it seems like he has decided to spare her life and decides to not kill her and move on with his life as he walks away she shoots him in the back and the book just ends i m so sorry the story isn t clear or there are not more details this is all my mum could remember but she said it was a really good book,1,0.75,0.25,0.75,0.25
reading the silent patient spoiler alert i m about through the book but i feel like a i can already predict where it is going below contains spoiler alert my guess is that the main character theo is perhaps who killed or play some mind tricks on alicia that led her to kill gabriel it is so obvious that his wife is cheating on him with gabriel and that his obsession to be alicia s therapist had a ulterior motive if it turns out exactly as what i predicted i have to say i will be disappointed a bit but nonetheless this is still quite a good book and page turner i m so annoyed by my habit of always doing this keep predicting amaylyzing the ending as i m not even half through a thriller detective story it just takes away so much the awe and fun at the end i guess a book with a selling point of a huge plot twist is that you go in there keep guessing what the twist is because you already know there has one you can t resist the urge to do it bc it makes you feel smarter than the other reviewers who said they re blown away by the twist it kind of just taking away the whole point of reading a story like this but i might be wrong about the ending though and i m hoping it s not exactly how i predict for it being so highly acclaimed so i think it must be more than that,1,0.83,0.17,0.83,0.17000000000000004

a quick returning reader s rant and a request for non stereotypical ya novel recs hi i hope this isn t too annoying to read i am new to this sub since i was ten years old i ve really liked reading i was part of the generation that grew up to reading popular things like the hunger games harry potter twilight percy jackson and romance novels from the likes of sarah dessen and even john green but also occasionally enjoyed stephen king but when i reached i grew out of it because life got hectic i felt like when i was reading i couldn t multitask or do other things and found myself having less and less time to do so i got into games and other hobbies must also have to do with my short attention span lol now during the pandemic i ve had a lot more time in my hands and i wanted to try picking up a book again also partly thanks to booktok lol and i saw a lot of recs about blood and ash so i tried it and probably because i m now but pages in and it just seemed funny to me now how the tropes seem so overused it doesn t excite me as much as it did before i haven t read shadow and bone but when i watched it on netflix i felt the same thing orphaned headstrong female protagonist turns out to be the chosen one who saves the world with the occasional love triangle i didn t think i d get sick of it but i am i just wanted to see what the hype was all about maybe i want more mystery now i honestly still love adventure fantasy and competitive plots like hunger games and stuff but i just don t want the same overused tropes being done does anyone feel the same way also if you have any recs for someone like me i d appreciate that i just wanted to share my sentiments thanks,1,0.85,0.15,0.85,0.15000000000000002

a little life if you have not yet read a little life by hanya yanagihara i m sure you ve at least heard of it i decided to read this book because i had been looking for something to really strike an emotional chord with me during quarantine i had been seeing vlogs about this book and how horribly sad it was and so i started my journey being pages and at times painful to read it took me about months to finally get through i found myself rereading sections when i couldn t get enough or angrily slamming the book down and ignoring it for a week there was really no in between after finishing i decided to come into this forum and see what other people had to say and honestly i m disappointed in a lot of you who have read it most reviews i ve seen are of people with negative feedback i thought the book did everything it needed to do nothing more nothing less if you are the type of person that will appreciate something for what it is read the book if you re going to be picking it apart for everything it s not then don t waste your time now did i think this was the best book in the world no do i think that it doesn t deserve to be read by others also no read it or don t simply i don t care what you do but anyway back to what i was going to say spoilers i think a lot of people missed the point here of course it ended the way it did it was telling from the beginning the whole point was that no one changed from the first time we met the four characters at lispenard street to the very end they remained the same and not just them others as well richard andy harold from the time we met them they were all striving for something greater than themselves and even when some of them achieved that it wasn t enough and i think that was very human of the characters i think the author would have done a disservice to jude if she did have him have some huge epiphany and change his entire life around to forget his past that s just not realistic life doesn t happen that way now i do agree with some who said the abuse was too much at times but i disagree with the idea that the author glorified suicide we felt judes pain and we felt willems as well watching jude we needed to understand exactly what jude was feeling in order to understand his behavior it almost felt as though we wanted him to kill himself so his suffering would end he lived a terrible life a life most people in the real world couldn t even imagine but who am i to say if the abuse was realistic enough or not i m sure there are real people out there with similar stories to judes there were times i was reading literally screaming jude just say you love him or jude just apologize and that s what i loved how it was never going to go the way you wanted it to just like real life,1,0.78,0.22,0.78,0.21999999999999997

i don t have fun taking my kids out my kids are yo twins and yo singleton sorry for the long post just trying to give details simply put i don t have fun taking them anywhere that costs money unless i can bring a tablet or they will actually have fun when they were younger small toys coloring books and crayons were enough from keeping them from getting bored as they get older it s harder to keep them occupied also no matter where they are they always call my name they will walk out of thier way to find me to help them open a capri sun no matter how many adults they walk past to find me it s frustrating the reason i m writing this post is because my husband is mad i don t want to take them to a mlb game he doesn t understand that i don t want to spend on kids who will do nothing but btch moan complain and constantly call my name if they bring thier tablets it s a waste of money he claims the field has parks and sht but i feel like why pay for a fancy park when i can make a min drive and take them to the bougie parks for free he then wants to say the only one who s going to btching and moaning is you and he s damn right i will be the only one tending their every need no one will watch the game but him when it s just him amp i i have tons of fun but bringing the kids makes me need a week mental break just to work through the amount of work a hr day out of the house will take i m not trying to be a shtty mom but unless we take them somewhere they want to be it s just the most awful experience a for me alone and a waste of money they even told him i was right they don t want to be there and he still won t listen i try to talk to him and he shuts me down he won t listen to reason i don t feel like wasting money on people who don t want to be there theme park county fair chuck e cheese and the sort hll yeah they wouldn t waste a moment trying to call anyone s name but the baseball game would only be fun for him i guess i mm venting because i don t feel like i m wrong to feel this way and save the money his reasoning is his brother s baby momma will want to bring their mo to be his first game why can t the whole family go first of all he s under a year old that baby just wants to be held and can t speak his needs if he s crying it s for food or a diaper change environment is distraction enough that baby is easy not our kids who think they re teenagers and like i said they only call my name no one else matters unless i send them that way i ve already offered to distract baby momma with a girls day have family watch the kids so his brother dad and him and can have a family bros time and we have some much needed girls time but he doesn t think its a viable idea i don t want to do this i guess i need someone to help change my mind or help keep my foot down so everyone isn t miserable,0,0.17,0.83,0.17,0.17

my son lies about everything i don t know if this is the right place to post this since most post seem to be about younger children and i apologize now for the length of this i have three adult children a is male t is male and p is female a little over a year ago a moved back into my home after he and his long term gf split up i was told the reason for the split was her drinking was out of control she was spending all their money on alcohol and going out every night i have no reason not to believe this as throughout their relationship he has come to me to talk about this very problem fast forward a year things have become strained because it came to light that a when still with the gf told his sister p that her father really wasn t her father he told her out of nowhere without discussing or telling me about doing it and told her she couldn t not speak or ask me about it my daughter is a sensitive caring amazing young lady she is stronger than she gives herself credit for but she has a tendency to dwell and over think things much like i was at her age in the years after he told her this she had become more and more depressed and withdrawn more and more from the family her depression got the better of her and early one morning last fall she took her bf medication while everyone was sleeping her bf luckily found her and we got her to the e r in time she made a full recovery and started therapy she was in therapy a couple months when she came to talk to me she told me what a had told her and she wanted to know if it was true i told her the truth he isn t her father we had a nice long talk that on and off spanned a couple days readers i may have not made the best decision when i didn t tell her myself but i have always done what i thought was best for my children i should have told her myself but hindsight is if they ask me something i always try to be as honest as possible i confronted a about it at first he lied to me and said that he didn t tell her when met with his sister and her bf her bf was there when she was told he changed his story he now doesn t remember telling her that was the beginning the beginning of an endless stream of lies that my oldest son has told to everyone after that incident things just unraveled the lies range from he was born in a different state and moved to our state in his teens he was born and raised in the same town and has never lived anywhere else i was born on the west coast and moved to the midwest in my teens to he is a opiate addict come to find out the break up with the gf had nothing to do with her drinking she couldn t take all the lies anymore he stole money from her refused to get a job while she worked jobs to pay the bills and just sat around playing video games all day he even when so far as to pretend to get a job at a local store had her drop him off at work everyday for weeks then after she left he walked over to his friends and played games everyday then walked back to the store in time for her to pick him up when she found out and confronted him he faked a seizure instead of owning up to it he s told everyone that he s a recovering opiate addict and that he got addicted to opiates because of me he s not and never has been i may be a lot of things but i would never give my child or any child drugs nor have i ever done opiates the lies go on and on i confronted him with all of this and his answer was to move out immediately like the same day he moved in with his father two hours away he has not taken responsibility has not admitted to anyone his lies nor has he apologized we have to deal with the crap that he s told everyone situations have come up where we have to explain ourselves because of the lies he s told he told a previous employer that he was raising his brother and sister because i was in prison and their dad wasn t part of their life she now works at that place and when her dad went into the hospital suddenly that employer made her show some proof so that she could get the time off to go pick up her youngest brother father s child not mine my daughter and other son are extremely angry with him they are no longer on speaking terms with him my daughter says she wants nothing to do with him at this point she doesn t want to speak to him or see him my other son is angry just for the hurt a has caused to his sister and me he also isn t speaking to a i ve tried to talk to him i ve messaged him and called he reads the messages but never replies he just had a baby i have yet to see my first grandchild i can t express how heart broken i am by all of this i don t know what to do i ve always taught them to be honest i ve always taught them to admit when they were wrong i ve always taught them to care about others i don t understand why i m at a loss i don t know what to say to him i don t know how to help him he s my son if i don t say anything than nothing changes and he never has any consequences for his actions i m at a loss,0,0.08,0.92,0.08,0.08

is reminding kids to do their chores everyday coddling them a little info so me and my husband have been married a few years now and each have two children from our previous relationship his oldest and my youngest decided to live full time at their other parents house they did not want to change schools but they still come over often so living with us is my year old and his year old son my husband has a very strict almost authoritarian style of parenting whereas i am admittedly probably too laid back but usually we both compromise and meet somewhere in the middle so it works out however he often sees things i do as coddling my child i definitely see it but my son had a lot of sensory health issues growing up and could not eat any foods that need chewing until he was after attending feeding therapy but i digress we ve started paying allowance weekly for chores my husband has verbally laid out what is expected of them a few times but keeps getting upset when things don t get done he says that if we have to keep reminding them to do their chores that they will not get paid even if it s just one or two reminders a week he feels this will prepare them for adulthood well i have been giving many reminders to get chores done if i m home and decided that i would make a chore board that hangs up in a common area and is easily visible when my husband saw it he got upset saying it was babying the kids i think that if there s something written down for them to see everyday and what is expected of them then it will make it easier for them to complete the tasks without a verbal reminder every time and then it is up to the kids to see it acknowledge it and them act on it but husband is against it since i m so lax as a parent i can t tell if this is this really coddling our children any input will be greatly appreciated,0,0.15,0.85,0.15,0.15
never let me go an excellent start to my kazuo ishiguro reading career right off i very much liked the narrative style i cannot recall if i ve ever read a book that focuses primarily on the narrator recalling their own memories in that sense it was very accurate sometimes kath would focus on trivial details like the colour of her blouse or the shadow falling on the fern patch where she sat having a conversation i m only guessing and it s not something that has actually happened in the book with either of her friends instead of actually on the conversation in any other book with an action and telling narration style it would ve been the opposite i think this narrative style drove home the point of the whole story which to me was kath reconciling her life and clinging on to every small bit of memory she could of a life long gone i ve seen posts and comments claiming that kath was an unreliable narrator but i think i have the meaning incorrect in my head because i don t think she is she gave us almost everything she knew then even when it was less then what the rest of the world in which she lived knew but that was only due to circumstance as to the characters i sometimes disliked ruth but then the next moment i would warm up to her just like kath did i think kath did a good job at showing the toxic codependence of their relationship without herself really being aware of it tommy is a bit hard to place for me and i m still thinking what i feel about him ruth felt like a believer who d react negatively to the truth while kath seemed like she d accepted everything it didn t even seem like she had to actively accept anything also i think it was evident to us readers that even though there was nothing completely wrong or abnormal with the students there was something off about them it was in part due to their upbringing lack of external interaction and knowledge of the world and the overall confused state of growing up the whole topic of sex and the way they approached it seemed to me so impersonal like to them it was just something like their artworks or heck even less intimate than those sex was just something that was done i liked how kath said that sex and later in the cottages the reading somehow became something that was being done and even if the others knew it wasn t there was no questioning or doubting i liked how she made a point how there was an unwritten code of sorts to never doubt this place where they all went to do all the sex and then the reading to me it highlighted the urge to fit in the obvious lack of knowledge of anything more and the fear of being viewed as someone different thereby isolating the said person i think it showed nicely the loneliness that all of them felt even though i was aware of the whole concept of them being organ donors before i d started the book i was sad when miss emily acknowledged that she was repulsed by the students too even when she and madame were fighting for them it was always for them to have a better childhood and never to remove the whole system and to fully acknowledge that they were humans because then they d have to go back to a world where cancer was incurable it parallels well with so many things that have happened happen in our world where because something does not affect our lives negatively on the contrary benefits us we are willing to ignore the real bitter truth behind it i liked that the book wasn t about a big struggle against the injustice but rather them trying to live the best they could in their very limited lives i kept on thinking why kath didn t just run off but i think as we neared the end of the book and she her life she was only trying to be more close to what she had rather than escape from it and that felt sad to me as the title says i m very pumped to dive into other works by the author i liked his detached storytelling approach where even though the writing was very practical and lacking emotions it managed to evoke feelings of melancholy i think this story will stay with me for a long time on how deep childhood bonds and memories are finally readers of the author and or this book what do you guys think about it all sorry for the word vomit post,1,0.81,0.19,0.81,0.18999999999999995

the vanishing half feels like a reskinned middlesex i might be noticing coincidental similarities between the vanishing half and middlesex just because i m reading them at the same time but the two have many thematic similarities and some weirdly similar but superficial plot points just a few that i noticed non linear structure than spans multiple generations fleeing an old life and taking on a secret identity lefty and desdemona hide that they re siblings stella passes as white how these secrets affect future generations cal and jude transitioning from female to male hitchhiking cross country to california and trans intersex struggle with dating and physical intimacy cal and reese slow mental decline of a grandparent that threatens to reveal the family secrets lefty and adele mention of race riots and assassination of mlk jr sections of both books specifically happen in new versus old money and families using cash to buy homes in affluent suburbs the walkers and the stephanides photography of factories and abandoned buildings julie and reese i think broadly they deal with pursuing the american dream when you re caught between two identities but there really are some similar scenes to the point where i found myself confusing the characters do you find yourself drawing these kinds of conclusions when you read multiple books at the same time,1,0.89,0.11,0.89,0.10999999999999999

sec participates in securities fraud july freedom of information requests shed light on the role the securities and exchange commission played in the puerto rico bankruptcy story by richard lawless in the early stages of the puerto rico bankruptcy many of the victims were screaming bloody murder finra received so many complaints that they had to hire additional staff to handle all the work but finra was not alone the department of justice also received a large number of filings claiming all types of criminal activity took place that led to the puerto rico bankruptcy but with the largest municipal bond bankruptcy in the history of the united states starting to move its way to the courts no one agency was busier than the securities and exchange commission sec the sec says the mission of the sec is to protect investors maintain fair orderly and efficient markets and facilitate capital formation the sec strives to promote a market environment that is worthy of the public s trust with seventy billion dollars in pending defaults and over fifty million victims mostly senior citizens the sec must have been concerned about how this came about and what they could do to prevent something like this happening again we thought we would put in a number of freedom of information foia requests and piece together the role the sec played in all of this two foia requests were made accepted and delivered to us the information we received dated back to mid and ran up to the current day what we found will amaze and confound even the strongest supporters of the american government the sec started to receive reports as early as july of that there was massive theft taking place at the various puerto rico municipal agencies there were credible reports that potentially billions of dollars a year were being stolen from these agencies and that the money was being laundered overseas and then it would come back to politician s families doj officials and united states senators and this was just the tip of the iceberg we counted over three thousand complaints and whistleblower reports that were sent to the sec between mid and june of the reports included forensic audits that showed the municipal agencies had been bankrupt for a long period before the bankruptcy filing as early as some have claimed the agencies would falsify their financials by claiming phantom accounts receivable as income to qualify for good credit ratings if you took out this phantom income the agencies did not have the sufficient income to repay the bonds in the years that followed it simply became a ponzi scheme where the municipal agencies would refinance that debt before anyone could find out they could never repay it no different than what bernie madoff did more than that the agencies included covenants promises in their bond offerings that would make the bond appear safer than it really was the banks fiduciaries and the sec knew that the agencies hadn t honored those promises for years but allowed the bond sellers to continue to promote those covenants promises even though they have proven themselves worthless for example if the bond issuer could not make the bond payment from their current income they would raise their fees to protect the bond holders a promise that was broken repeatedly now you would think that with evidence like that the sec would have moved against the bond issuers the rating agencies and the banks think again based on the sec s lack of actions it was clear the sec felt this was all okay what if i told you that the foia disclosures showed that the ratings agencies knew that the puerto rico municipal agencies were bankrupt when they issued their good credit ratings or that the banks knew they were bankrupt when they sold the worthless bonds to their best customers based on foia documents this all happened according to the sec so why didn t the sec take action on these obvious and major securities violations foia documents appear to answer that as well it appears that between late and mid the ratings agencies and banks sent our u s senators over one hundred and twenty million dollars in political donations those donations resulted in favorable legislation that would protect the municipal agencies the rating agencies and the banks in addition there were recorded telephone calls that implicated senior u s senators in their effort to provide protection for the money they received by pressuring the sec leadership to stop all investigations and regulatory actions you see according to the foia documents the cia was tracking large wire transfers coming out of puerto rico and going to venezuela when they started to wiretap those involved with the wire transfers they found out about the political payoffs doj payoffs and u s senator bribes this went on for a number of years and those recorded telephone conversations were offered to the doj twice once by the cia and once by me the doj declined to accept that evidence anyone can request these public documents through a foia request and can confirm all these facts for themselves my advice to you and your friends think twice about investing in bonds or anything that flows through the american financial markets there is no one looking out for your best interest mr lawless was a career banker investigative journalist and the author of capitol hills criminal underground mr lawless has written extensively about the puerto rico bankruptcy and his articles have appeared in over fifty major publications,1,0.56,0.44,0.56,0.43999999999999995

war amp peace ugh just finished war amp peace and honestly i m a little disappointed the book is so popular and came very recommended by many thinkers of our time that i follow i was expecting profundity and beauty but instead the characters came off a bit flaky and i felt that it was unnecessarily long my takeaway was that there s merit to noticing the beauty in the ordinary and that good and evil resides in each of us there were some insightful parts don t get me wrong but not as many as i was expecting anyone else feel this way or did i just entirely miss the point,1,0.87,0.13,0.87,0.13

off topic question what do you think about chiropractors for context i recently posted a series of questions to askdocs subreddit to include my symptoms etc someone in neurosurgery responded with a potential diagnosis i went to an orthopedic physician to try to either get confirmation or to be led the right way i had a horrible experience where she didn t take me serious whatsoever so i went to another ortho clinic where i was immediately referred to get an mri and see a spine specialist as well as internal medicine they took it much more serious and believe the physician on askdocs is completely correct i have not seen the spine specialist but regardless of answers here i will so don t worry about that i went to internal medicine where the physician seemed to write off the potential diagnosis from the ortho clinic and ordered a series of labs to test for inflammatory diseases and is going to order the imaging that i had done so she can see it now i can t get seen by the spine specialist for at least a month but my mri is scheduled for next week curiously i went and saw a chiropractor who has a pretty good reputation in my area within minutes of me talking he knew exactly what was wrong had the same diagnosis as the ortho clinic and the physician on askdocs he walked me through the anatomy and explained everything and why i was having the symptoms he even showed me where he saw signs of the diagnosis on the x ray he even told me i need to have a physician confirm and to ensure i was not having vascular issues as well or a dvt and that he would feel better if i went to the er that s when i explained to him that i already had a diagnosis but i was reserved about chiropractic care and wanted to see what he would say before i told him the truth to test the waters the diagnosis was exactly as he was saying i agreed to let him do a manipulation more out of curiosity than anything i didn t think it would do anything other than pop my back because cmon now however after he did it i felt one of my big toes go cold i realized i was feeling air blowing onto my toe then the side of my foot and realized that i had been numb on that side of my foot until he did the manipulation i ve been having these issues for over years and until now no one has been able to figure it out or i get blown off so with physicians agreeing it s it waiting to see a spine specialist and suddenly a chiropractor who knew right away i m a little in shock the chiropractor seems to think he can help treat it with manipulation and essentially physical therapy that he would show me how to do the spine specialist is likely going to tell me i need back surgery i m not going to lie but i always thought chiropractors were quacks but i m really starting to second guess myself is there really any evidence that they can non surgically fix things how the hell did he know right away what was wrong when it took several physicians and over years just to get some answers amp how the hell did he get feeling back in a foot when i didn t even realize i couldn t feel that part what do you guys think i mean seriously what s the real consensus about chiropractors i didn t know a better sub to post this on since i know a lot of moms see them,0,0.48,0.52,0.48,0.48

does gentle parenting prepare children for the real world i ve been hearing about a parenting style called gentle parenting a lot over the last few months i have seen videos of parents talking their children out of tantrums while maintaining a calm and respectful tone it seems like a wonderful way to help kids find solutions to their problems and to be in touch with their feeling while at home and around family it appears to be an efficient method however how do these children react when they are outside of their homes it is not uncommon for teachers to yell at their student and for other children to hit and scream at their peers if this is not something that a child experiences at home i can only imagine the shock that they feel when they are in a new environment parents who use this method or others who have more knowledge on this topic how does gentle parenting affect a child s ability to socialize in environments outside of their homes,0,0.07,0.93,0.07,0.07

the midnight library i have mixed feelings about this book this is a book about suicide and regrets the protagonist follows thru with the suicide and finds herself in a library where she gets to pick a book and live different lives i liked the science fiction fantasy part of the book but halfway thru the book it turns into a self help book the part about confronting regrets in her life and what could have been if she had chosen differently was fascinating to me the ending was predictable with a somewhat happy ending despite some of its flaws i would recommend this book there is inspirational messages in the book despite the depressing subject of suicide,1,0.92,0.08,0.92,0.07999999999999996
cormac mccarthy s other books other than the road no country for old men and blood meridian the first books i read by mccarthy were the three part border trilogy all the pretty horses the crossing cities of the plain i loved the first two didn t like the last as much but it got me into his idiosyncratic writing so i was well primed when the road came out i think this book has been discussed a lot on reddit along with blood meridian these two books are probably the most emotionally wrought for me books i ve read then there s no country for old men which is also amazing and probably brought mccarthy into the mainstream after the coen brothers movie version was released i read suttree earlier this year and it was quite the experience i ve never read a book like it almost unknown compared with his other main books but some of the most amazing writing i ve never felt more in a scene than during this book felt like i could reach out and touch the scenery or smell the smells and it s a very strange story structure i don t want to spoil anything so won t elaborate too much the point of this post was to see what other books of mccarthy people have read outside the big three i ve not read his three earlier books before suttree and he only has books in total so i ve read of his published books would like to hear what others think of suttree or the border trilogy,1,0.75,0.25,0.75,0.25

no parenting education why is parenting such a neglected topic in schools and in general discussion it seems like all our problems can be solved by giving a good start to the little monsters is this because with religion gone we have a hard time finding a common denominator to speak about human topics or because it s such a personal matter and people prefer to just avoid things or leave them up to chance rather than have difficult conversations i m a little confused it really should be a first and major topic in general education,0,0.54,0.46,0.54,0.54

toddler scared to go outside hi she is two and a half years old she has gotten jump scared a couple of times and now she is afraid to go out it started two weeks ago at the zoo we were watching tigers pretty close when one roared loudly and she got very scared this one is on me then couple of nights later her table fan got busted in the middle of the night made a really loud sound then a couple of days later again there was a sudden thunder strike right above us that made a huge noise and she got very upset so now for almost a week she has been scared and curious of all sounds but what s worst she refuses to go outside especially our own yard where the thunder happened she will go to the store with us timid but fine and she will walk from the car to the house and if she gets distracted by a squirrel of something she may stay out for a minute then run inside she is ok at the playground if we go by car and just stand around for minutes first so she is too young to understand reason so explaining thunder to her doesn t help we have told her that our dog is scared of thunder as well and asked her to help the dog with it which she does super cutely she explains to the dog that she doesn t need to worry thunder is gone etc so she understands its gone and not coming back so that makes her fear irrational she thinks all sounds outside are thunder we explain that it s an airplane a truck whatever which she repeats and which we hear her repeat to herself later as well still all sounds she assumes are thunder first what do we do i m trying helping her little by little blowing soap bubbles at the patio jumping from the patio ledge to the ground etc trying to have super fun near the outside and her mother more or less tries to drag her outside to walks on a stroller etc which start with crying and reluctance and maybe she calms down before they arrive back home how can we help our child get over the fear of sounds and fear of thunder and fear of going outside again shes is two and a half years old so too young to actually understand reasoning thank you,0,0.06,0.94,0.06,0.06
why do people claim that all the characters in wuthering heights are terrible people heathcliff and hindley are basically monsters i wouldn t really describe catherine the first one as a monster but even so i would say she s still irredeemable linton heathcliff is certainly unlikeable but not evil in the way that other characters are joseph is just plain annoying however lockwood nelly and catherine the second just seem like ordinary people who have done both good things and bad things i consider all three to be at least somewhat sympathetic characters especially catherine she was basically kidnapped at seventeen at the same time of her fathers death and after all that still managed to eventually push aside her bitterness apologise to those she had hurt and move on she acted very bravely throughout the novel in standing up to heathcliff too iirc edgar linton and hareton did practically nothing wrong at all hareton showed consistent desire to improve himself despite his incredibly traumatic upbringing and edgar only ever did what he believed to be the best for his wife and daughter isabella made a mistake when she was basically still a child she was at the time she got involved with heathcliff and did her best to fix it especially impressive considering how unusual and looked down on it would be for a woman to try and leave her husband at that time i feel like i m missing something really obvious here because literally every post online about wh seems to focus on how awful every character is i know people like to exaggerate but i ve never seen anyone even acknowledge the positive actions of the other characters this seems particularly odd as to me at least part of the novel is the story of a younger generation trying to free themselves from the mistakes of their parents despite the fact it feels nearly impossible at times also i am aware that the narration is very unreliable and i may not have fully considered that when making judgements on the characters these are just my opinions after reading it once without studying it properly or trying to analyse it in much detail what are your thoughts on this,1,0.66,0.34,0.66,0.33999999999999997

daycare policies if your child gets sick from the daycare which leads to the child missing say a week or two should a daycare credit you for those days what is your take opinion not to go off topic but i personally think i hate daycare more than taxes i first developed this hate years ago when we were told that we get a week vacation after year being enrolled i question everything so to be clear i asked if we get a week free to my surprise the answer was that i get to take my kid out without paying kid cannot stay there during that time this is the moment i realize its going to be a long ride by the way to get around that you can simple put in the required notice to take your kid out then pay the application fee to have kid re enrolled x weeks later if you do not plan staying taking more than tw weeks then and only have one child then it might not be worth the fuss,0,0.17,0.83,0.17,0.17

what do you think of j m coetzee somewhat surprisingly travel limitations brought me a renewed interest in reading international authors like it was in the pre ryanair and pre airbnb times when travelling was less affordable than it is now i did not find autobiographies particularly engaging before but now they interest me most i can say the same about books that extensively describe environments their main characters live in not long time ago i came across john maxwell coetzee s books once again i ve heard his name first time when he got a noble prize for literature i might have read one of his short stories in the past but back then the world seemed to be bigger and things he wrote about were distant there was more to explore back then in my near proximity so i read disgrace only now it is not an easy read a book about south african post apartheid society shown through the life of a father and his grown up daughter it is also about metoo and the abuse of power as well as the relationship between generations it does not have positive heroes and it has very thorough conversations and reflections the book is about difficult topics and shocking events for this reason it is uneasy to read but it is also difficult to leave it it is because j m coetzee s writing is light and crystal clear he puts words together like crystals in the snowflakes there is a film disgrace with john malkovich for those who prefer movies it is a good film if you are not looking for a fairy tale then both the book and the film really stand out,1,0.8,0.2,0.8,0.19999999999999996
recs for robin mckinley books for someone who didn t love sunshine i just finished sunshine and i loved the long prologue in which sunshine gets kidnapped by vampires and kept in a lakehouse to tempt constantine into eating her but after that there was so much rambling and info dumping it felt like being inside the mind of someone with extreme add unpacking sentences was a chore since sunshine would begin talking about vampires and then insert anecdotes random thoughts jokes and recipes to be fair i listened to the audiobook so maybe it would have been less annoying to physically read the novel i was exasperated to the point of shouting jesus christ take a damn breath in a crowded train i get it was more of a character study but i feel like all of that character development and world building went nowhere i ve heard that this is mckinley s style but i remember having read deerskin a long time ago and this not being the case i m super interested in a lot of her fairy tale inspired books but i m reticent if they re going to be written like sunshine so can you guys recommend me your favorites of hers,1,0.94,0.06,0.94,0.06000000000000005

i always wanted to read more but struggled here are two tips that really helped me read shit you like if you want to read to learn about the civil war but the books you have are droning and boring then don t read about the civil war watch a documentary on it or use a more engaging medium to get your information after being engaged in a more exciting way you might have a stronger interest in reading civil war books but if you re just trying to accomplish the goal of reading more start with things you like don t start off by reading through some james joyce shit do some research online and find a book that you think you d like i took a list of reddit s top rated books and worked my way down so far it s been really good the top one on the list is hitchhikers guide it s smart hilarious easy and interesting it didn t feel like a chore to read it and after i finished it i had picked up some momentum and started reading other books on the list which so far have all been great have a comfortable spot to read i didn t realize how important this was until i started using this anti gravity chair in my backyard when you re really comfortable it s so much easier to sit still for long periods anyway those are two things that really influenced my reading habits i hope they re helpful to anyone on here who struggles with getting excited about reading like i do,1,0.91,0.09,0.91,0.08999999999999997
behavioral emergency plans atypical kid my son is almost he has issues executive functioning stuff sensory stuff motor planning stuff we think he might be in the autism spectrum but evaluations in the past haven t concluded that a couple times a year usually when things are changing school ending school starting etc he gets a sort of behavioral inflammation where he has aggressive outbursts becomes physically aggressive is extremely oppositional a lot of the time he always brings some drama to our home but it s miserable during these times he also takes his frustration out on his sister telling her he hates her and pushing her or throwing things at her when we aren t looking usually they re soft things usually it seems more like a gesture than an intent to actually hurt her but it s scary we work hard to help him but we still seem to be blindsided by these episodes and how disruptive they are i wonder if others here have similar patterns they have to manage and if so how you do it,0,0.2,0.8,0.2,0.2

what will happen if all women disappear from the planet do they have any other value than breeding i came across all these ideas i couldn t find an answer that didn t interfere with emotion or was not based on the opinion of a society that defined a woman s place as the kitchen maybe they were right until i found a book that showed that women can make a difference after deciding not to obey the laws of society that limited her freedom and value as a woman a girl started a magazine in which she expressed herself as a woman resulting in a series of events and i d love everyone to read this book link to download the book in the comment,1,0.89,0.11,0.89,0.10999999999999999

gah i feel like i m going crazy any tips for sleep re training i have a beautiful four month old girl i could gush about her forever she used to sleep pm til am most nights plus two naps each day from and until approximately often she d even have a wee sleep in and let us lie in until eight it was bliss then it all went belly up in the worst way we were evicted from our townhouse not our fault the flat got sold and we were asked to leave because the new owner wanted to live in it so for several days our little girl had to suddenly get used to sleeping in her travel cot and having restricted space to play while we packed away all our things slip hazards and choking hazards everywhere moving with a toddler is no picnic then we moved into our temporary accommodation a horrendous studio apartment in the middle of the city damp cold paper thin walls neighbours would beat each other up and one of them had a pit bull that he let wander about off lead our girl is used to sleeping alone without anyone else in the room so suddenly she had to endure having me there but committing the unforgivable sin of not interacting with her i spent an embarrassing number of naptimes hiding from her in the bathroom while we both cried we spent a month there in amongst it all organizing the purchase of a property going to my antenatal appointments i have many due to complications regarding my unborn son going to other medical appointments due to suddenly falling very ill i blame the stress which just keeps on building and a whole bunch of other crap basically any semblance of routine has been completely destroyed with naptimes ranging from fifteen minutes to four hours sometimes spent in the car some days she hasn t managed a nap at all because we re both so flat out and she has to come with us we have no one to look after her her bed time routine used to begin at about five thirty we d finish dinner have some quiet playtime and then she would have her teeth brushed have a bath a bottle a half hour snuggle max and then i d put her down to sleep dozy but awake with plenty of dummies in the cot so if she needed one she could grab one now bedtime routine has been pushed back to about seven she didn t get a bath for a month and instead had to get used to showering which she loathed if i tried snuggling her for less than an hour she would wake up and yeet her dummies at me until i paid attention to her but somehow by some miracle our amazing clever resilient daughter managed to kind of get with the program and find ways to sleep and recover naptimes were still rocky but she figured it was okay to sleep with me there she no longer gave me a blissful twelve hours of sleep and instead slept from about eight until am hey i ll take it my friends babies all wake around i m still lucky as hell but now we ve moved again after our month lease was up we fled from our slum studio apartment and we ve chosen to stay in a hotel for the next four weeks until we can move into our new house i ve just put my daughter down for her nap and it took almost an hour to get her to stop screaming i m not proud of this but i screamed back at her at one point fucking hell i m losing it and of course it made things worse i feel like i m going completely crazy i had naps meals and bedtime down to a frigging art and now it s like i have to learn to do it all all over again and if we re moving into a new home in a month and we re not certain of that either because we ve had multiple surmounting problems with our mortgage broker i m going to have to do this all over again i m worried i m worried about how all of this is going to impact my daughter going forward i m worried about how the stress is affecting my health and more pressing my unborn son i m worried about my husband who has held it all together so well but is clearly cracking under the pressure of it all i just wish i could have some support,0,0.06,0.94,0.06,0.06

medical question abnormal cbc results my one year old has his year check up weeks ago and had a routine cbc blood panel the results showed his platelets were high so they ordered another one to take place in weeks today i got the automated results in his online portal and not only were his platelets still high but his immature grans were significantly high at standard max is up to and his abs immature grans were therefore also high they were totally normal a few weeks ago of course i googled this since it s friday and i can t reach his doctor i read that most commonly high immature grans granulocytosis is caused by bone marrow disorders like leukemia so now i am freaking out i did also read it can be caused by bacterial infections such as ear infection or strep but is apparently very high from what i ve read and i m unsure if a percentage this high can be the result of a bacterial infection he also hasn t a fever at all or any noticeable rash or pulling at his ear that would indicate strep or ear infection i don t know what to do as a next step should i request additional types of bloodwork like an inflammatory panel should i ask them for something as extreme as a bone marrow biopsy another retest of the cbc in a few weeks or am i overreacting and it s likely a bacterial infection without obvious symptoms i just have no idea what to do first time mom and want to protect my baby,0,0.05,0.95,0.05,0.05

what book did you have high expectations for but ended up being disappointed by a week ago i saw someone post what book did you have low expectations for but ended up being absolutely blown away by instead of thinking about what books surprisingly impressed me i ended up thinking about some of the books i ve read in the past that are considered classic literature and yet never managed to finish because i either got really bored or found the characters annoying and immature i know i should do a better job at internalizing the characters because every book obviously has a story to tell with some nugget of wisdom and i do research about the author and the context of the time but i still really find some books unbearable two examples of books i never went past a quarter of are atwood s the blind assassin and twain s the adventures of huckleberry finn i found the blind assassin rather pretentious and i found huckleberry finn just really annoying i may be missing the point and i d love to hear what others think of these two books and what other titles out there disappointed you in one way or the other,1,0.96,0.04,0.96,0.040000000000000036
do you guys think it s ethical to read the mists of avalon despite everything the author did yesterday i watched the movie version of the mists of avalon and immediately wanted to read the books and as i always do i tried to find some chapter by chapter discussions to read along with that s when i found out that marion zimmer bradley was a gt pedophile lt i m not going to get into her daughters testimony here you can find it yourself if your inclined to i wouldn t recommend it so now i m finding myself in a bit of a moral dilemma and i figured this sub was the perfect place to discuss it is it ethical to read the series still on one hand mzb is dead so it s not like she s profiting from it and apparently this book had a lot of positive impacts plus the profits are going to a charity but on the other hand i don t want to promote her name or her legacy now i ve had no problem reading other horrible people in the past like lovecraft but i feel this situation is different lovecraft has been well known as a racist for decades upon decades while the allegations against mzb have only been out for seven i don t think her name is associated with her actions like lovecraft is to his like if someone hears lovecraft they immediately think racist but if people hear mzb they may still only think of her in a positive light but on the other other hand i m not sure i would even want to read even if it s ethical to do so because i m not sure i could stop thinking about the author while doing so it s the same reason i can t watch woody allen movies so what do you guys think have you come upon a dilemma like this before what did you decide to do,1,0.91,0.09,0.91,0.08999999999999997

i love being a father i remember when my fianc e was pregnant and i would go online to read about the months and years to come and there were so many posts about how people regret becoming parents i love my kids but and how they wish they could go back to life before children well i want to give some nuance especially for parents to be since i was in that spot just half a year ago my daughter is now months old and she is an absolute joy she has been a bit screamy and there have been a few issues with nursing sometimes she fusses when you are just not in the mood and it s super annoying i was extremely annoyed when i took her for a walk as she was testing out the limits of her vocal cords both in terms of pitch and volume but this is so easily outweighed by the positives that it s absolutely laughable my daughter fusses for fifteen minutes at bedtime then falls asleep at around pm might wake up once at pm but then usually sleeps until am and wants to eat she then sleeps to am and wakes us up she sleeps in another room by cooing and babbling to herself when we go to her we ll find her playing with one of her cuddle toys and she gives us the widest of smiles we put her in the bed between us and she will try to grab our noses and hairs and laugh and smile a lot she has strengthened our bond to both our families and spreads joy wherever she goes even if she is sometimes annoying i swear just seeing her smile makes you forget and forgive ten times the annoyance that she can cause the first time i was alone at home with her and gave her a bath while she smiled and then laughed at being tossed into the air in play was when it all first really clicked she s really playful in the evenings and is starting to develop her own personality all in all i couldn t be more happy with my decision to be a father and i want others to know that it s not all sacrifices and work it s also joy and love,0,0.09,0.91,0.09,0.09

what makes a book an epic novel this seems to be a hard question for me in one aspect that is non fantastical fiction i tried looking at the article on wp and found nothing specifically about non fantastical fiction only homor epic fantasy etc some characteristics i might point to are a novel that spans years a book dealing with the political dramas of say america or for instance like years of solitude how it spans many generations while all of columbian history of the time takes place with it we are witnessing it through the words or a book that details explore the human experience fully by reckoning with our absurd nonperceivable god existence like in search of lost time,1,0.95,0.05,0.95,0.050000000000000044

baby won t gain weight my son is weeks old and has stalled out at around lb for the past weeks it s like he won t gain weight no matter what we try we were exclusively breastfeeding for the first weeks at weeks when he fell off his growth curve we tried supplementing with formula and then pumping and giving breast milk in a bottle neither of these things made any difference so last week we did a trial day of just formula similac pro advance and he got oz he seemed fussier and had a couple blow outs but we chalked it up to formula poops the next morning he had lost a pound and was dehydrated so we ended up in the hospital he was having diarrhea at this point and it seemed like we couldn t get enough food in him at the hospital after fluids he was back to lb oz they put him on similac alimentum his poops cleared up and he gained an ounce so they sent us home on saturday he s still on the alimentum eating like oz a day but his weight is still sitting right around lb this morning he actually weighed a couple ounces less than yesterday morning he s eating way more than he should need for his age and weight so i m at a loss he s not having diarrhea just regular formula poops but he is pooping a lot like times a day on breastmilk he pooped like times a day he did have low pancreatic elastase when he was admitted to the hospital so we are retesting that in a week i guess that s a sign of cystic fibrosis but my ped was not sure that s the problem since he has no other symptoms as his poops are back to normal not greasy not diarrhea he also was screened at birth and negative although it s possible he could still have cf even with the negative result he s not spitting up he s not fussy he s not gassy he s always been a happy baby if i didn t know the weight gain was an issue i would have no idea anything was wrong our ped is great and we have a plan to do more blood work on monday but the waiting is excruciating i am worried everything will be normal on the results but he still won t be gaining i m scared we re stunting his growth and development by not helping him grow i m just at a loss at this point and feeling a little hopeless has anyone had anything like this happen i think i m just looking for others experiences or any ideas at this point,0,0.02,0.98,0.02,0.02

baby scared of grandma baby just turned one she hasn t seen grandma in like months but she s such a friendly baby she warms up to some people instantly others who she is scared of make sense ie someone much taller than myself and daddy she is afraid of my husbands family friend who is around her grandma s age she just won t seem to warm up to her she was around grandma daily up until six months old when we moved grandma has come to visit and she is afraid of her i mean grabbing wads of my clothing and skin ducking her teary face into my chest and screaming mom mom mom grandma had approached her calmly the first time she saw her a few days ago and gently touched her elbow to test the waters but it was instant scrunchy face and tears she s not warming up as soon as she is okay with being near grandma while myself or daddy hold her grandma will approach sometimes the tears begin with approach with a gently touch to her arm or hand or a few moments after grandma starts holding her yesterday grandma was exercising just like arm stretching and i was near holding baby so i faced baby toward grandma standing on my thighs and moved her arms just like grandma was moving shortly after she allowed grandma to hold her for about a minute while content before crying baby will let people she has never even met before hold her and just start excitingly talking to them i know this might come up so i don t think it s me or daddy we have a great relationship with grandma she s the best in law i could ever even imagine she s give us her last dime if she thought we needed it that s how kind i believe her to be i don t want to stress baby grandma is staying with us of course so everytime grandma is near she gets on edge or just starts crying she didn t have any issues her first six months of life with grandma she even babysat her while husband and i went out sometimes alone she loved grandma now she s afraid her uncle is her as well and she has no problems with him unless she was just upset by grandma s presence or outreach it only seems she afraid of people of that age range s she used to be very friendly with people around that age when we were out smiling laughing or talking with or without them initiating the encounter she s always been so friendly just wondering if anyone has any advice on how best to approach this we re being patient right now but trying to keep grandma totally out of sight i fear that d just reset the whole process over and over advice is much appreciated,0,0.03,0.97,0.03,0.03

do you need to know cultural context to enjoy a book hello book lovers i wanted to share with you my way of reading books because i m curious if anybody else does this long story short before i read the actual book i m interested in i feel like i have to read all the other books of this author in chronological order to see the author s development look up what books influenced the author read them watch the movies if the books were adapted read all the books of the writers who influenced the author to understand them better and why the author would love reference them bonus points for watching film adaptations read the author s memoirs biography to understand their motives look up every single reference and read the books the author is referencing to as you can see this is a very huge to do list for a one little book i haven t ever done all of these items but i ve tried numerous times and as you can guess i failed every time and lost interest for the initial book i can t just chill and grab the first book i like from the library because i feel like i wouldn t understand it even if it s a badly written ya novel full of clich s you can imagine what a pain it is for me to watch movies which are usually crawling with references so well i m having a hard time reading or watching anything because i m afraid i wouldn t understand it fully but back to the books do any of you read like that if you do you re a hero do you think deep knowledge of historical and cultural context is that important for reading a book if you like a specific author do you read books in chronological order or just pick the ones that look interesting thanks in advance for your replies,1,0.97,0.03,0.97,0.030000000000000027

i just read et glass melk takk a wonderfully written tale of human trafficking i don t mean in the title that the stuff is wonderful just well written this book literally made me speechless i finished reading it maybe weeks ago because i forgot this sub exists and also wasn t sure how people would react to a book that may not have been translated to many languages i myself read a finnish translation of the book the title translates to a glass of milk please it s about this year old latvian girl who is convinced to move to sweden to work in a cafe so she could help out her poor family she s actually taken to norway to be a prostitute i m not going to spoil anything else if you re interested in reading it all that i mentioned reads in the back cover the book honestly made me a little sick after reading it i researched the topic and found that sex trafficking is surprisingly common even in wealthy and almost crime free nordic countries and how some people can do such horrors to other people and care so little for their well being is there anyone on this sub who s read it any thoughts,1,0.74,0.26,0.74,0.26
i hate sex scenes as the title says i hate sex scenes in novels this is mostly it s because it s always so perfect even if it s the first encounter between teen virgins they always feel each other s bodies perfectly they re so in synchrony every touch has to send a thousand electric volts through their flesh and they use flesh a lot there s never any awkwardness for first encounters the woman always orgasms extremely vociferously and the man always knows exactly what to do to get her to that state and they always climax together every damn time and it s always described so prettily she was hot and smooth my knife to her butter yes that s an exact quote other popular terms i ve seen are rhythm stirring of souls something to with stars or heaven moving silkiness being as one you get the idea and it s like sure it s nice but seriously it s not pretty or poetic it s a rather messy and sweaty activity but somehow no one ever talks about the smells or stickiness no they always taste like cucumbers or cherries or honey and they smell absolutely wonderful i m not saying sex scenes in book should go into all the detail about the mess but the ones i ve read try and make it sound so pretty and clean you can probably tell this really annoys me i get that you d want to sound nice and language y but this is just setting up unrealistic expectations and standards especially for first encounters it s such a minor thing compared to everything else that could be wrong with a novel but it always breaks suspension of disbelief for me and makes me roll my eyes all the way to the back of my skull why no i don t like romance novels or even romance subplots unless they actively contribute to the story and aren t just excuses to shove in sweaty descriptions of perfect milk white breasts and huge bratwursts,1,0.75,0.25,0.75,0.25
importance of timing with books recently i was thinking about how you can read a really good book but not enjoy it or understand it based on your age timing of life for example one of my favorite books is the catcher in the rye which i read at i wouldn t recommend the book to anyone much older than that a lot of people don t like the book especially on this thread and i get that another example is the first time i read one flew over the cookoo s nest i read that at and didn t really get it i re read it recently and in the context of the world today understand williningly going into an asylum i was wondering if anyone else had other books that can be hit or miss depending on the reader,1,0.86,0.14,0.86,0.14
jg ballard and empire of the sun plus complete short stories continued i posted awhile back about the complete short stories collection i had only got through at the time some replies reccomended empire of the sun during the discussion now i have completed the full stories and went onto empire of the sun i previously read crash and high rise and i will move onto the autroicity exhibition when i go back to his works so the short stories were just incredible as a whole i had assumed that as the stories progressed i would see a glimpse of more car crash sexualisation what i wasn t prepared for was his actual fascination with flying and aviation and violence mixed with this the notion of time as a construct was his fixation in his early work and then space society and how much space people can have or how people are restricted within their movements in a post apocalyptic type world i didn t love all of the works after the s my favourite stuff was the more philosophical aspects or an individual focus on instantly compared to the fixation with aviation and violence however i did like the story of the husband thought he was a pilot who would save his wife from cancer but she had actually divorced him i am also not averse to violent stories in general so when i read empire of the sun and a brief biography of his life it all finally made sense i know the story wasn t his exact experience in shangai during the war but the cramped living conditions the interest in aviation his own career paths before he became a full time writer the description of the internment camps it all just clicked into place i have seen comments that people thought this was a lovely heart warmer or perhaps its based on the speilberg film version but i found this book so desperately sad as its based on true life events how he managed to survive at the end had to be wrapped up a bit conveniently as jim s story as a child on his own strayed from the fact if jgs experience if this wasn t based on true events i would be tempted to contemplate at the end as jim himself starts to go mad was he actually dead they don t need to kill us we re already dead type explanation my heart burst for jim the exposure to death cruelty manipulation illness and starvation and all taken in the stride of a child desperately clutching to the fact he would get back to his parents the parts where he had a photo of an adopted family amongst other things all culminated for a bleak reality i felt the family reuniting was anticlimactic not because it wasn t wasn t right thing but just the hopelessness of war where do they even go from there after living through such trauma,1,0.47,0.53,0.47,0.53

if a fictional universe has dragons and magic in it there s no real reason it can t also have black people or asian people in it i think the idea of fantasy worlds are so cool i love seeing dragons and magic and struggles between good and evil it s all amazing to me but when some people get their panties in a twist about forced diversity because one background character is darker than others it just makes me think that you re too indoctrinated by this political climate we live in to enjoy the actual story there s a fucking dragon getting slayed but you are pissed there s an asian wizard in the background in the climatic fight scene that doesn t sound like an actual grevience sounds like a personal problem i ll take it a step further i don t care if main characters are diverse if it s a fictional world not based on any real people i say go nuts people say it s pandering but litterally it s all pandering white dudes get pandered too so much they don t even notice it like a fish in water let me have a bad ass asian dude on a quest to unite the four kingdoms with a bad ass party full of knights and wizards i don t care as long as the story is good but someone being a different skin color in a fantasy setting that s not based on actual things that happened doesn t and shouldn t bother anyone,1,0.87,0.13,0.87,0.13

just a few questions on overstepping my sons aunt has a boyfriend and this is a guy who at every turn is telling him not to cut up when he s cutting up i don t have a complete issue with this because sometimes your kids just listen to other people for some reason but there were a couple instances today where i feel like he stepped in where he did not need to answer honestly if you feel like he was or wasn t the first instance would be me playing with my son and he hits me pretty hard in the face and i m in the middle of reprimanding him and aunts boyfriend cuts in from across the room and starts doing the same thing as i am doing it i felt like he was not in a place to do this being that i had it under control and was in the middle of scolding him for doing that the second would be me playing with my son while he pretends to be a dog and he put the tail of a stuffed animal in his mouth and goes to bring it to me this is me and and my son engaging one on one he is not engaging with anyone else in the room the aunts boyfriend demands he takes the stuffed animal out of his mouth as we are in the middle of playing this little game the manner in which he told him to remove the toy from his mouth was authoritative and demanding and i felt that it was not necessary for him to say at all son s mother doesn t think this was overstepping but i disagree and i believe he was she also believes that the only time it would be considered overstepping is when it came to physical discipline or putting the child in time out and i believe that those two instances are not the only times someone should be considered to be overstepping,0,0.13,0.87,0.13,0.13

fiction book costs should be based on page count or word count note the below applies to paperback and ebooks as i do not purchase hardbacks precisely because of this issue ebooks should not cost the same or more than the paperback price full stop books are overwhelmingly ridiculous in their pricing why does a book that is only pages cost why is a different book pages and why is it so hard to find books that are reasonably priced for their length books that end up being pages or less should not cost more than what nonsense is that based on the above i would be interested in a more standardized means of determining price the default would be page count the alternative would be word count for books with page quirks like house of leaves which had multiple blank pages set an industry standard for cost per page be done with it signed a frustrated reader who just wants to buy some books darn it,1,0.82,0.18,0.82,0.18000000000000005

i read the collector by john fowles and the novel was more than just a thriller the collector is categorized as a thriller but there was a lot more to it than that fred clegg a loner and a nobody kidnaps a young female art student miranda because he is obsessed with her if you were expecting a stephen king novel you ll be disappointed sure there are elements of the story that definitely make the novel a thriller but i read the story as an observation of class tensions in early s england fred was an uncultured twenty five year old guy who did not care for the upper class snobbery with their la di da accents fred came into good fortune when he one a lottery then known as the pools and used his fortune to buy a cabin in a small town two hours drive outside london his newly purchase cabin was retrofitted so that the cellar was escape proof miranda was an attractive twenty year old art student who represented the cultured upper class with refined taste and a cosmopolitan out look on the world the first half of the novel is written from the perspective of fred and the second half is written from the perspective of the imprisoned kidnapped victim miranda over the same timeline to make a long story short fred symbolized the new the uncultured who now have lots of money in other words the nouveau riche these people had lots of money but lacked good taste miranda called herself the few the few are those who although may or may not have money but they are sophisticated who have upper class cultural tastes and care about pressing issues of the day such as the nuclear arms race and the fate of the world with the escalating tensions of the cold war in the end miranda the few dies and fred the new survives another day to prey on another victim the author used the metaphor of kidnapping and death as his fear of what was happening to england in the post war generation newly gained wealth was destroying the established culture people who have lots of money but no appreciation for culture and the surrounding world will end up destroying the finer things in life that was my take on the book the categorization as a thriller and even a horror story was not the point but rather a vehicle for social commentary,1,0.82,0.18,0.82,0.18000000000000005

fantasy has more mainstream popularity than sci fi because there s more emphasis on character and story the title says it all this subreddit goodreads and other forums all love talking about fantasy whether classics like lord of the rings or modern stuff like stormlight archive and lightbringer but how often do we discuss sci fi someone will bring up classics now and again but modern sci fi seems to be pushed to the side just look at how many fantasy book series are getting tv or film adaptations vs science fiction adaptations i can t think of a major one besides the expanse but here s the thing the expanse is more like fantasy in a lot of ways sci fi is often more about big ideas and themes or exploring different types of societies that s all well and good but it often winds up making the characters into cardboard cutouts just there to spout off platitudes and the storylines are just them walking around observing things i like the foundation series i just hardly remember the people in it on the flip side fantasy and the expanse are about people doing things they re saving the world going on quests assassinating each other having big battles and they have personalities that make us like and care about them game of thrones got popular because it made us like people like ned stark and jon snow before putting them through the ringer and or killing them for all its flaws the genre is entertaining this isn t a call to action just an observation i ve made,1,0.89,0.11,0.89,0.10999999999999999

i dislike it when books are described as diverse or inclusive because they have poc main characters or takes place outside the west as a south asian i am glad books with poc main characters and settings outside the west are gaining popularity but i find it irritating when people automatically label those books diverse and inclusive it makes it sound like those books exist to teach a white mostly american audience about inclusiveness rather than to tell poc non western stories it feels rather tokenistic again that s just my opinion i don t mean any offence,1,0.98,0.02,0.98,0.020000000000000018

year old girl is far too rough and full of attitude when my child is carrying on she takes it too far and kicks or hits or headbutts and she sees it as play fighting except she puts force behind it so it no longer seems like playing she is also constantly thundering about without a care and often breaks things another thing she does is not listen i can call on her by shouting as loud as possible and she won t answer or she won t know where i am and doesn t seem capable of determining where a voice comes from like if someone called on me from upstairs i d be able to work out it s coming from up there i ve told her many times this behaviour isn t acceptable and she often stomps off rolls her eyes or replies with some sassy remark most of the time she is well behaved but it seems rules at her dad s house is different so she thinks she can behave the way she does there at my house also she seems incapable of having internal thoughts like instead of thinking to herself about getting a drink she ll say it out loud and she has zero clue about stranger danger despite me telling her tons of times and will happily tell her full name age who i am where she s from etc etc it s really frustrating,0,0.13,0.87,0.13,0.13

apocalypse pregnancy does every female protagonist need to be pregnant i m a big fan of apocalyptic and post apocalyptic fiction and after reading too many of these books during the pandemic it s abundantly clear this trope is completely played out i get it it s human drama on a primal level it s one of the ultimate fears in a world without modern medicine it s not a death sentence like many other medical conditions no one is getting a new heart valve installed or liver transplant but it feels like i ve seen every conceivable variation on this theme and i hope authors will note how over saturated this is in the genre it s bad enough that as soon as a female protagonist is having sex you know the story is going to revolve around her pregnancy and honestly it smacks of a little casual sexism it reduces otherwise complex characters down to this narrow view and reason to survive it gives every generic leading man a righteous cause to fight for i get why it s used but it s time to let a female protagonist have a different obstacle thoughts i fully recognize it s part of the human experience so it s inherently going to be a part of fiction and as a father it does have intended gut punch for me imagining trying to care for my own daughter in these circumstances it s effective and breaks my heart every time i read such a story i just wish it was so pervasive that the moment a woman particularly if she s a protagonist hooks up with someone i know where the story is going,1,0.74,0.26,0.74,0.26

just finished stardust by neil gaiman spoilers so i ended up picking up stardust by neil gaiman yesterday since i love the movie so much and wow i don t think i ve finished a book that fast in forever lol to be fair it wasn t a very long book but i seriously couldn t put it down all day today it just had such a fantasic whimsical vibe i m pretty sure i was smiling through the whole thing i love fantasy so much and the way this book was written just made me feel like a little kid again in a weird way i also really love how the book showcased just how polite and kind tristan is since that s one of the reasons the movie drew me in so much he s such a great character aghh i love him i think my favorite part was a bit near the end that was like and i m reallyyyy paraphrasing here tristan couldn t believe how long it took him to realize how much he cared for yvaine and he told her and she called him an idiot and he declared it was the best thing he d ever been called so cute what the helllll also really loved how the main witch couldn t steal yvaine s heart anymore since technically it belonged to tristan now seriously made me tear up i think my only complaint would be septimus wasn t in the book as much as i thought he d be though when he was in the book he was still just as cool and intimidating as he was in the movie haha honestly most of my complaints w the book are just well i like how the movie did this part better so i think it doesn t really count when reviewing the book objectively overall it was such an amazing read and i m so glad watching the movie persuaded me to pick it up definitely one of the rare cases where i prefer the movie over the book but it was still was so much fun to read this was also the first book i ve read by gaiman and i absolutely love how he writes the guy ringing me up at the book store told me he loved gaiman and that the ocean at the end of the lane was his favorite so i think i might check that one out next also i think reading books physically instead of on my phone helped sooo much with focusing whenever i read a book on my phone it takes me forever to get through it even if i like it because i m just so distracted definitely need to start buying books physically again haha,1,0.9,0.1,0.9,0.09999999999999998

oh man just read scanner darkly and i was not prepared for how depressing it was spoliers it hit me pretty hard because i made some bad choices in my late teens early s i m now and i could really relate to the addiction spiral and losing friends to drugs ironically i finished do androids dream and was really bummed about how it ended it doesn t end with the note of tiny hope that bladerunner does quite the opposite but i loved the style and thought i d grab another dick novel i was hoping this one would end better wow i was super wrong keen to watch the movie adaptation now i read that they make hank turn out to be donna which is a great twist that i didn t pick up from the book i can t bear how it ended so in my head canon arctor gets the flower to the feds helps dismantle the drug network and eventually reclaims his mind after years of rehab,1,0.89,0.11,0.89,0.10999999999999999

anyone just not happy about sending their kid back to school in what would usually be an exciting time of the year for the first day back at school none of us were really thrilled about the situation my daughter is and is more introverted like me so she did just fine with distance learning and didn t miss being around kids at school she was not excited to go back in person i didn t try to force her to be happy about it but i did just encourage her to do her best to navigate the situation the small city right outside our city just had to send about kids home because within one week of school resuming several kids had already tested positive which caused upwards of kids to self quarantine for weeks today was our kid s first day back and well we re just waiting on the inevitable i emailed the principle and she really offered no plan just that they will continue to follow what cdc recommends which doesn t sit right with me my issue is if kids have to self quarantine several bouts throughout the school year i might end up losing my job because i can t just up and take weeks off anytime my kid will have to quarantine i don t have the sick vacation time for that and it s likely they ll relinquish my position i just hope i m not the only parent here who sees this entire situation as royally fucked up,0,0.02,0.98,0.02,0.02
almost yo gets hyper frustrated if he doesn t succeed at first try i wonder if there are parents out there who have experienced something similar with their four to five year olds my son turns in august and gets so so frustrated and i mean hyperventilating ugly crying for sometimes to minutes when he tries to do something and it doesn t work out immediately and to perfection for example a lot of kids his age already know how to ride a bike he tried two times with our support and then kicked his bike screamed and started crying like crazy the same with learning to write out letters he wants to but when he tries whichever way copying connecting the dots and it doesn t look exactly as the original he throws a tantrum of an epic scale we have tried consoling him talking him through it accepting his feelings etc but at some point we just want him to stop crying because it annoys the hell out of us we have a more or less easy going and calm parenting style and try to be there for our boys when they struggle when we praise we have almost always tried to compliment the process and the way they do stuff instead of always saying you re amazing you re the smartest kid etc we re really at a loss here especially because he starts preschool soon and we don t know how he will ever learn something if he is so damn hard on himself its heartbreaking and annoying at the same time how do we get him to find joy in trying things and in practicing anyone,0,0.1,0.9,0.1,0.1
y o with some characteristics of autism but generally neurotypical assessment or not tl dr y o possibly has some characteristics of autism but is generally neurotypical imo should he be assessed i m worried about labeling him or making something out of nothing recently my husband and a family member brought up autism regarding my year old son my son he is a stubborn little guy and does not like trying new things for example this summer he has been very resistant to learning to ride his wheel bike and when we went to an amusement park he was reluctant to ride the roller coaster in both cases he did learn to ride the bike and did go on the roller coaster my son is also very interested in science stuff and knows lots of facts about animals volcanos and the earth he will go into detail about these subjects when asked but he does like and do other stuff lego drawing playing video games building toys robots etc etc he does really like jumping on our couch old couch we let him go for it he will jump for mins and it looks and sounds like imaginative play and he has told us he is pretending he does this once a day maybe sometimes more it does remind me somewhat of stims i ve seen in other kids i m a teacher he will do it for a bit and then move on to something else we have also had some worry about him making friends at the beginning of last september i spoke to his teacher because he was always alone on the playground she said he interacts with kids in class during center time and suggested that sometimes kids have difficulty with the unstructured play of outdoor time we were unable to see how he developed in terms of play making friends due to school closures because of covid he does have lots of cousins and a neighbor that we connect with regularly he seems to enjoy playing with his cousins of the same age he also plays regularly with his sister who is he is very chatty is reading at grade level has conversations a great sense of humour he is in soccer and likes the warm up half of practice but doesn t love actually playing the game he says there is too much pushing etc he likes gymnastics swimming and being read to loves cuddles and rough housing with dad he is a sweet and sensitive kid should i get him assessed for autism i m worried about labeling him when it might be unnecessary i also have a half brother with aspergers,0,0.08,0.92,0.08,0.08

is my strategy developmentally appropriate hello i have a high energy year old he does fine in school few behavior problems in other environments that i am aware of our challenges with him are his complaining when he doesn t get what he wants making fun negativity and being argumentative our most common consequence has been to remove electronics as it is a motivator for him that is the first thing to go in addition we might tell him we don t feel up to making his favorite food or buying him a special food or perhaps he might lose out on a play date as well when he is not being kind etc if he is really acting up in addition he is sent to his room this entails hours at most which i don t like doing but it is effective this time there have been no screens for days while we encourage more positive kind behavior we clearly spell out what we are looking for at least we feels it is clear and he expresses understanding tell him we know he can do it he continues to whine and complain etc we have given him consequences all along so that is not new to him what is new is the level of adherence we are looking for as his issues are not getting better and we believe he is old enough that we can expect him to be kind positive neutral most of the time we look at ourselves and work hard to make sure we don t give him attitude negativity or argue we are of course far from perfect here and work hard and apologize if we lose patience with him he has never been spanked or physically disciplined we never have called him a name etc he has lots of parent and friend time and has a good daily routine plenty of sleep and nutrition what bothers me is how upset he gets saying thru sobs i am never getting my ipad back i can t do it meaning he can t change his behavior he ll say he can t help it life doesn t matter etc he feels defeated in those moments we tell him he won t have screen time the next day we encourage and tell him how hard it is but that we know he can do this it s hard watching him so upset i feel in my gut that it is just the difficulty of behavior change and tendencies that unfortunately are more natural for him at this point it might be weeks before he shows consistently positive behavior i mean we are looking for not and gets his ipad back has anyone taken screen time away for this long or had similar challenges and can give me some encouragement or other things you have tried for reference screen time limits have typically been hours on a school day and hours on off days during the summer screen time days where he didn t have other plans could be hours but that isn t the norm he plays with buddies on line i can hear them talking and playing and they do pretty well for year olds roblox usually thanks in advance,0,0.08,0.92,0.08,0.08

don t really know what to do my y o daughter has had an issue with throwing objects kicking doors hitting her mother and i etc for awhile now well due to her being grounded for stealing hitting throwing toys and putting another hole in her bedroom door from kicking it she s been in her room since yesterday only coming out to eat we went in her room to check on her and see how she was doing to discover that she s been dumping water from her bathroom all over her bedroom floor we immediately went to start cleaning things up after a long screaming tantrum that occurred upon the discovery during this time my wife went to go put her toys in the closet and she started throwing everything she could at us my wife lost it and threw one of the toys back at her it being a lego and it scratched her across the cheek and broke the skin currently i m sitting here incredibly pissed off and not knowing what to do or say about this they ve spoken and i ve spoken to my daughter she says she s not mad at her mom and knows it was an accident but i still feel as if this was taken completely too far my wife feels like my over reaction to this is worse for my daughter than what she has done in her eyes since my daughter has had no problem hitting us and throwing stuff at as that maybe this is the wake up call she needed and that she didn t even mean to get her in her face but i don t think a year old is going to see it that way am i overreacting or is this something i should continue to stand my ground on this i m completely at a loss,0,0.05,0.95,0.05,0.05

sos yo biting issues i m a first time mom to a baby boy he is going to be year old this saturday i ve been really good about just following my instinct with him and he s been developing and learning so fast and he is such a smart and sweet little boy but he has started to bite occasionally again when he turned about months and teething had begun to get bad he started to bite us i worked with him and was able to get him to not bite us but instead use a teether or his blanket it seemed to get better and he never really bit us again purposely now i m noticing it s beginning to happen more frequently again he isn t currently teething and i notice he starts to bite when he s getting tired or irritable ready to go down for a nap i ve tried so many approaches and i m finally at the point where i need some advice from other parents the approaches i ve tried are not giving him an over the top reaction after he bites so he doesn t do it again to get another reaction from me stopping him when i see he is about to chomp redirect him to bite things like teething toys his blanket a damp washcloth etc showing him things that are okay to bite gently tap his mouth with my finger and tell him no biting kane that hurts using a stern voice telling him no kane biting hurts mommy we give mommy kisses not bites after i use any of those methods he ll immediately put his head on my chest and will stay there for a minute before he continues to play which leads me to believe he understands what i m telling him i m hoping this is just a phase to work through again i ve worked in daycare specifically in toddler rooms so i am determined to not let my son become a biter if anyone has any kind of suggestion or anecdote that worked with your child please let me know if anything at least i was able to vent my frustrations,0,0.01,0.99,0.01,0.01

first time parents think their child won t ever have tantrums i recently went on vacation with a couple who has a just turned year old she is very sweet and well behaved we have a year old and an infant they are first time parents who are totally infatuated with their daughter and every new skill she learns they think she s the smartest child ever it s very cute to see our year old was well behaved but had a meltdown at one point she got too excited and was up in the year old s face trying to talk to her play with her showing her things after asking her a few times to give her space and to calm down and her not getting the effect she was having by being too much i removed her from the situation i tried explaining that she cannot act that way with a younger child and she can be scary for smaller kids she didn t take too kindly to that and she ended up in a time out there were tears and some yelling on year old s part but eventually she calmed down and all was well the next day we were discussing it i apologized to them for the disruption and they assured us that they understood she s being a kid my husband made a comment you just wait year old is next haha they said oh no way they we re serious and shook their heads this struck me because i remember having those same thoughts i would see other children misbehave and i couldn t imagine my sweet angel ever acting that way she was so polite kind sweet natured of course after about my angel baby turned into a full fledged toddler demon and i realized that my child is that child maybe their child will be the of kids that don t go through a tantrum phase i made that number up but i m sure there s at least one child out there who remained an angel forever maybe i just can t get it out of my head for some reason i get it i was there too but now having an older toddler it s so crazy to me that this couple honestly thinks their child will never have tantrums or meltdowns,0,0.04,0.96,0.04,0.04

rereading sentences constantly when i read manga i tend to constantly reread sentences as if they aren t registering in my head kinda like i put a voice to the characters and if my mind doesn t say it right i re read it in my mind so that it s sound right idk if this is me constantly thinking of how the manga would be in anime format cuz i constantly think about that as well when i m reading something i like or that i m trying to get too much information for example if i m reading something like takagi san or nagatoro i can read it alright but if i m reading pandora hearts or some other story focused manga i spend a lot of time on chapters rereading for the previously mentioned reasons and maybe others i cant put into words and maybe it s me thinking that every word they say i need to know because it s somehow important if you couldn t i m worried that this will affect my enjoyment of manga i love any advice on how to avoid this or if anyone is going through the same thing fyi i haven t read a illustration less book a regular novel book for enjoyment purposes for a while so i m not if the same issue will persist but for school books of course this isn t an issue another reason could be that i maybe trying to be too critical of the work instead of enjoying it,1,0.89,0.11,0.89,0.10999999999999999
riding the school bus vs drop off if you have the option to drop your kids off vs letting them take the bus what are you choosing to do this year my yr old is special needs and going to a different school so he ll be taking the bus with a paraprofessional chaperone assigned to him my six year old s school is closer but i like like convenience of letting him take the bus and letting him socialize buttttt my mom doesn t like the idea because she s worried about him being bullied and because of so many school shootings and such she s anxious and paranoid about her grandkids as opposed to when i was growing up she thinks i should just drop him off not to mention covid ultimately it s my decision i don t mind either way what are you all planning to do with your younger ones this year,0,0.01,0.99,0.01,0.01
i just read the first two books of earthsea by ursula k leguin and boy do i have some thoughts on the matter yeah what it says in the title i m currently in the middle of the third book and i have all the rest of them too first no spoiler talk if you re reading this post but haven t read the books the first a wizard of earthsea didn t grab my attention as soon as i started reading it as i felt like the storytelling was a whole lot of telling and very little showing but i quickly powered through until i was eventually engrossed in the story what made it click is when i realised that this book would be really good to read out loud to someone else on the other hand the second book the tombs of atuan grabbed my attention from the very start and i loved every single page of it i won t discuss the third yet because i m not done reading it but i really wanted to share my thoughts on the first two from here on out there be spoilers may this be your warning the tale of ged sparrowhawk became interesting only after he summoned the shadow in my opinion before that it was a lot of setup but little substance still ged s character arc is well realised and he as a character grew on me rather fast after the incident i really like how the conflict in this book rarely goes into combat and even when it does it s rather brief and is never the ultimate solution to whatever problem is at hand i interpreted ged s conflict with his own shadow as representing his growth out of his juvenile arrogance as at first when faced with the consequences of it he takes refuge from his shame in excessive humbleness even giving up on his dreams ambitions and talents but ultimately the real solution isn t to destroy the shadow that embodies his past arrogance but to embrace it recognising that it was a part of who he is and learn from the experience going forward it s not the most complex thing in the world but i really enjoyed it however the second book is where things get really good ged may be a very likeable character but he s not particularly complex or nuanced but tenar i think tenar is a great character extremely well rounded and full of nuance a lot of it unspoken but merely shown through her actions her tale gripped me from the very start and never let go until the book was over not all of her actions are good but that s not a bad thing because we get to see the psychological burden that doing those things placed on her also we really get to explore the effect on her mind and feelings of the indoctrination that she got from a very young age by being grown in a literal cult of death seeing ged again is very welcome but tenar is the absolute star of the show the mystery and suspence in this book are top notch tenar gets to be a very strong and yet vulnerable character who is prisoner of her circumstances but eventually breaks free by realising that she can exercise her own agency through compassion thumbs up all around especially considering the landscape of fantasy literature when she wrote these books i can t wait to read the rest,1,0.96,0.04,0.96,0.040000000000000036
the neighbors again so a few months ago the neighbor children about or kept bugging to play with our children and now i kinda sensed that they just wanted to come over here to use my children s play things we have a trampoline and a big wooden playset we decided just to indulge them because husband was like well at least they have friends even if its just to come use the play stuff they did include our children in play it started becoming an all day everyday thing we would wait for these children to go home and they never would go home even when my children came inside to eat the parents are hardly home and when they are they just set in thier cars all day i think they have an older sister who is considered the caretaker of them the children would come over here saying they had no food in the house then saying that they couldn t cook food unless a parent was home my husband got them used to having candy bars and mcdonalds because on payday he goes out and buys our kids junk food or if we have food stamps its nothing for him to run up the street and buy ice cream to spice up thier days we decided to limit contact last week around our childrens birthday because my son had a little breakdown telling us these girls called him poor then they day before that something happend outside and my son started screaming at one of the little girls to go home from what we have learned these little kids have had the cops called on them by multiple nieghbors for trespassing and throwing things at thier homes they call every white lady on our street a karen i guess for not wanting to be bothered by them now we have been staying inside and not letting our children even go outside because the whole family was suppose to be on quarantine for covid they said they got tested and were waiting on results the next day after i told them they were not allowed over here because of that they came over saying they got results in and nobody has covid meanwhile my husband has phemonioa so now i don t trust them to even be up front if they ever did have covid the past days every few hours and sometimes every few minutes these kids are knocking on my door my children are quite happy playing together behavior has improved and even sleep has improved for my oldest they have no interest now in going outside for some reason at the moment i m hoping just telling them no every time will wear off and they will find something else to do however one of them asked if my fence was my private fence and now i can t stop to wonder why they asked that husband is worried we will have to uproot our childern over this once again i don t want to be mean and be like go the fuck on somewhere but i m at a loss to tell them no you all are kinda bad for our kids we are worried once we are mean they will start damaging our property or doing something to our children once they are old enough to ride the bus to school its sad i feel like we are kinda being bullied by some little children,0,0.04,0.96,0.04,0.04

what does and doesn t count as one of the classics for you there s no universally agreed upon definition or list out there that defines what is or isn t a classic the closest we get to that is probably taking a large publisher s classics line and see what they sell as a classic but of course depending on the publisher that can vary wildly so i am here to ask you how do you define a classic do you have any rules limitations can a year old book be a classic does a book have to be commercially successful and widely known to be a classic what books have you seen on best classics lists that you don t consider classics i am aware that in the end it s just a label and doesn t really matter but i ve recently started cataloguing my recent reads for some statistical analysis and realized i am not really sure what reasonably counts as a classic,1,0.61,0.39,0.61,0.39

objectively defining socratic parenting not to say that parents who provoke their children to anger have the slightest motive of abuse on the contrary their intentions are almost always benign consciously at least we have to make sure that the gentle the sweet the kindly the good has its proper opportunity these are the things which must ultimately succeed over patterns of anger or criticism which inevitably lead to new struggles destabilize the entire household and cause greater damage to the relationship provoking the child to become defiantly angry argumentative and withdraw to injure at times beyond repair a relationship that earlier was of great value to them and even after years of effort in setting idealistic standards the autocratic parent might come now to an impasse of beneficial influence on the child s development,0,0.07,0.93,0.07,0.07
start kids early in exercise tara bernardin the world is an ever evolving fast paced society and i think we need well rounded people to occupy it to create these individuals i think that mental health exercise and other outdoor activities play an important role because they can act as stress busters in this crazy world we live in we are often so involved in their own lives and worries that we sometimes forget about the children and the tensions they have and face as they go through their day to day lives in school and with their friends a child should be involved in some kind of arts sport or outdoor activity in order to get his mind of his studies and projects that he would have to finish studies have shown that children who are involved in sports or art projects are more likely to take on life s challenges head on and be more social outdoor sports or activities such as soccer baseball or even throwing a ball around helps children expend energy which can lead to weight loss and overall a start them on a healthy lifestyle obesity is a big problem here in the us it can lead to severe health problems and also as well as mental issues the most important thing of involving sports and the creation of art as a stress reliever and tapping into talent is finding that thing that particular child enjoys and cultivate it the lasting impact and enjoyment is immeasurable,0,0.16,0.84,0.16,0.16

read about books in a year before i didn t read much there is nothing like the wisdom of humanity challenging your way of thinking and bombarding you with numerous perspectives to question who you are and what you do society tends to be a little caught up in absurdity and telling people what to think instead of making them think certainly books are not the only source of knowledge but they are one of the best ways to naturally promote introspection ironically and unfortunately self help is the most useless genre at best it tells you ok advice in an excessively verbose way at worst it s just a confusing ramble of a narcissist with intermittent anecdotes fiction on the other hand can be both very enjoyable and insightful if i read more in the past i am pretty sure i would have avoided more stupid mistakes and worried about less stupid nonsense it s harder to get lost in your thoughts if you keep reevaluating them through other thinkers constantly and for that alone i think that reading a book a week can be very helpful can t wait to read the next book that makes me feel stupid,1,0.83,0.17,0.83,0.17000000000000004

a clockwork orange discussion i think this book is a cautionary tale it depicts the recklessness of youth and the consequences of that living hedonistically at the expense of others doing drugs hurting people one day that behavior will catch up with you and you will be caught you cant get away with that forever or you will suffer consequences with your health the other message or point of discussion is how society deals with these people ie brain washing them and taking away their freedom the book questions if this is the right thing to do what i don t understand though is the altered version with the final chapters taken out or the movie ending its a much darker ending where in the end he doesn t learn anything and it seems to hint hes just gonna go back to his old ways im not sure how to reconcile that but i think it just has to do with at the time anti heros were becoming a thing and happy endings werent popular anymore,1,0.51,0.49,0.51,0.49

doctor sleep way better than the shining this post is probably gonna infuriate some people i know because many users here are diehard stephen king fans so even if it s constructive criticism they re gonna get mad at me in any case i have to tell my story because i just finished doctor sleep and i wanna talk about it the shining many people s favorite book i didn t like it i think that stephen king failed to integrate the themes of alcoholism and supernatural phenomena it s a shame because i really liked the first half of the book it was very clear that sk was very experienced in the topic his exploration of jack torrance s alcoholism was phenomenal which is why the story turned out to be very disappointing particularly in the second half this because he completely dropped the theme of alcoholism from the book and yes that is my main complaint the second half of the book doesn t mesh well with the first one doctor sleep is way better in this regard sk managed to integrate both themes seamlessly and gave new meaning to lots of moments in the shining that desperately needed a different interpretation i think it s really great that the sequel to a book i didn t like was this good,1,0.79,0.21,0.79,0.20999999999999996
my month old won t sleep and my wife and i are at our wits end to start off i understand that sleep issues and sleep training are controversial topics to begin with as everyone feels that they have their right solution to the problem the issue goes as this my wife has always nursed my son and she has always woken him up to feed him as part of the night routine even up to his one year old party sleeping has not gotten much better than walking at least twice a night which apparently my wife was ok with since she enjoys the night feeds that typically included a false start wake up before midnight we had talked about possibly sleep training but she has been engrained to think it s akin to child torture and wouldn t on moral grounds we just had a major move last month and sleeping has not gotten any better in fact it s worse he wakes times a night and is harder to put back down i know he needs to sleep through the night for his release of growth hormone and development and for our sanity because my wife has not slept more than consecutive hours in over a year i feel that this deprivation is causing severe stress too our marriage and mental health i need advice on how to solve this problem to the best of both our wishes and as quickly as problem as of right now i m starting to wait minutes before getting him and when i do it s taking at least min to put him back down tl dr my child won t sleep and my marriage is cracking,0,0.03,0.97,0.03,0.03

just found out my dad is paying my cousin when he gets good grades high school my uncle told me this today apparently if my cousin gets a certain gpa per quarter semester overall he ll get a certain amount of money and it goes up for a well my cousin just ended his junior year and told my dad he was expecting to be at or very near a my dad gave him the money and then when he finally got his grades he had a so because he did well he got to keep some of the money but my dad asked for a portion back because rightfully he didn t get a guess he was hounding him consistently until to the point that my aunt got involved my dad responded nastily and now it s a whole situation i don t care about my dad requesting the money back it was weird he gave it to him before the grades were finalized but whatever a deals a deal here are my issues bribing a child with money for good grades also pretty infuriating because i would ve been rich if i had this deal going with my own father cause i didn t very well in school in high school major overall college grad school attributing money with good grades is odd to me maybe bribing a kid with a shared experience like a sports game or weekend trip at the end of the year but money is so weird and he also was giving him a lot like for a for a semester or the whole year not sure on the timing he incessantly called my cousin the day he found out he didn t get the to give him back the money then called his mom and left them nasty messages what are your thoughts on this specifically with the bribing for good grades i don t have a good relationship with my dad so i think he s trying to hang on to the younger kids in the family,0,0.12,0.88,0.12,0.12

just finished the princess bride charming and enjoyable of course particularly the famous extended sequence where the masked man in black fights inigo montoya fezzik and vizzini one after the other those scenes are truly a highlight of swashbuckling adventure even if it s a parody but it s a very fond parody which is something that the best parodies usually are i was surprised by the framing device with the authors digressions about the fictional author and the book he was adapting his fictional family and the writing business they were funny original and interesting but also surprisingly bitter at times in a tone that is not that suited for child readers like his loveless family although i suppose most of it would go over their heads if you have th anniversary edition my advice is to skip the th and th anniversary introductions and the buttercup s baby teaser chapter while they are funny extras i think when considered as part of the book they are a bit too much and tip the balance away from the adventure the book works better if you think of those as optional extras and not as part of the main experience,1,0.63,0.37,0.63,0.37

brown parents brown parents a god gifted plot for hilarious memes their abstract straightforward thinking that s nowhere better captured than here of what an indian parent says to their kid from mildly intruding to outright crazy all your life struggles are thrown right out of the window with the universal saying of humare dino main when just to get to school they crossed rivers fought dragons walked on thorns amp acing all of it with rs in their pocket it s cute how staying away from them is directly proportional to you thinning down no matter even if you gained pounds you will be considered as undernourished amp a good reason for eating that extra chapattis also let me warn you the concept of dieting is outlandish to them amp they overlook it by averring it as one of those unreasonable stuff made up by angrez for self torture we were once your age too works as a knight in shining armor in believing they understand every aspect of their kid s life but in reality they often fail no human is perfect amp understanding they can be erroneous while keeping all their deep rooted cultural aspects aside apologizing should be a thing cross countering or questioning what elders say shouldn t be considered disrespectful rather a healthy open ended conversation the dynamics of the constantly changing world is an alien concept to them maybe it s due to the generation gap or their own experiences but anything unconventional amp different is considered immoral amp displeasing it becomes very tough for kids to open up about their sexual preferences real identity career choices romantic partners etc parents fail to understand that a kid is not an extension of them but a person of his own but apart from these variances in sentiments we are enormously fortunate to have them of course a little progress would be appreciated but let s admit that maa ke haath ka khana amp the chappal is what we ll be missing wherever we go,0,0.27,0.73,0.27,0.27
just finished richard wright s new book the man who lived underground i finally got my hands on richard wright s long unpublished novel the man who lived underground and i absolutely loved it i d been in a funk when it comes to reading and this snapped me right out of it i was enthralled from the first page books from the early s rarely come off as so vividly depicted for me but i could see every scene laid out in front of me perfectly well so well in fact that i couldn t help but imagine how beautiful this story would be if it were adapted to the screen big or little i know it s a well worn pairing but a mini series starring daniel kaluuya and directed by jordan peele would be incredible having only read native son when i was young and dumb i don t remember it too fondly but richard wright fully captured me as a fan of his work with this so i will promptly be rereading native son to hopefully reframe it in my mind now that i m not in the same ideological space that i had been while reading it for the first time i think i hadn t learned quite enough about the world when i read back in my early years of high school regarding the man who lived underground though i haven t seen a whole lot of buzz surrounding this book despite its recent release after sitting around for around years anybody else read this what are your thoughts,1,0.89,0.11,0.89,0.10999999999999999

parents upset i asked to wash hands before holding baby my mother who s vaccinated agreed to watch my month old daughter while i went to a doctor s appointment my mother was cooking lunch and my dad who isn t vaccinated had awaken from his nap i was in the kitchen with my mother holding my baby he reached for my baby and i asked him to please wash his hands first he then proceeded to tell me that he is clean because he took a shower earlier that morning and proceeded to reach for my daughter i then told him because my daughter had recovered from covid recently that i am being extremely cautious and because he s not vaccinated to please wash his hands before coming into contact with baby or her personal belongings bottles toys etc my mom then interjects and informed me i was being extremely rude to my father and that it s not fair to ask him to wash his hands if he just took a shower hours ago she went on to explain how he s clean because right after his shower he laid down for a nap then proceeded to tell me that if i continue to make my father feel bad about choosing not to be vaccinated and constantly asking him to wash his hands before interacting with his granddaughter that she will never babysit for me again so i packed up my daughter and left she then sent me a very passive aggressive long text message stating that she s disappointed in me and how hard life will be if i continue to run my help away because it takes a village to raise a child she then said it is extremely offensive to treat unvaccinated people like they are tainted with poison i did not respond to this text message,0,0.09,0.91,0.09,0.09

picky eaters no like really picky i m sure this is a topic which has been beat to death but i need advice here my girlfriend has a year old and he is beyond a picky eater i have researched it a bit and realize there is actually a condition which i think he may have i m talking like things he will actually eat none of which are healthy he says he doesn t like anything else but i know that s not the case because he liked pizza until he asked what the sauce was to which his mom replied tomato sauce big mistake now cheese pizza is disgusting and he even acknowledged that he liked it until the word tomato was said we have gotten him to branch out and try chicken a few times plain salted chicken breast but it s a chore and i also noticed he was cutting them into tiny bits and swallowing them without even chewing my girlfriend tried to get him to eat some rice the other day and it was literally half an hour of crying and throwing a tantrum it s really frustrating for her and i and she always eventually caves which the kid knows will happen and i m convinced he just waits until she does so he can get his way we haven t been together for long so i haven t felt overly comfortable taking the reigns on this one but it needs to happen i just need to find a way where he can see that this isn t just a punishment or a take a bite of rice then you can have pancakes and syrup sort of thing if anyone has some advice or experience dealing with insanely picky eaters i would much appreciate it thanks in advance,0,0.2,0.8,0.2,0.2
this is not my child but i m speechless okay i ll try to put this in a nutshell my fianc has discovered she has a year old sister my fianc s father just gained custody of the child she is extremely misguided her mother whom she had lived with for years essentially locked her down in a hoarder house for the duration of her life now i ve known this girl for a month and i can tell she s beginning to view me as her father figure her father isn t much better than her mother is he essentially lets her run rampant last time she was over at the house she showed me a list of pedophiles that were trying to meet up with you one in particular individual wanted to meet and get a dog involved i can t make this shit up she ended up staying at our house for days but was only supposed to stay for one i feel so bad for her and her past she is so lost she seems to enjoy the attention these pedophiles are giving her she s admitted that she s met one this is a massive red flag obviously another is trying to meet her at a hotel thursday i will be getting law enforcement involved to catch this sick bastard im here today because i need advice this isn t my child but this year old girl has no guidance whatsoever i am a human i ve experienced some substances such as weed and don t care for it much but for a year old to be addicted to it so young is just mind boggling to me she listens to me and i appear to be the only one who cares about her well being she has a big heart but does not know how to interact well with others due to the circumstances of her past in conclusion i come here to ask what can be done to help steer this girl on the right path my fianc s father is a pit head and doesn t give a rats ass about what she does the fact that he won custody puts it into perspective on how bad she was being treated with her mother i m just lost this girl will grow up to be in the family as time goes on but i don t want to see her get hurt does anyone know how to go about this i m concerned as she ages that things will get worse than they already are,0,0.14,0.86,0.14,0.14

keep going or quit the large public school district my kids attend offered free camps this summer through various organizations one of which has a reputation as an excellent technology educator for coding robotics app creation etc the cost to attend that provider s classes as extracurricular activities is high and the camps are free my son age attended one for ages and up it was robotics and programming the robots they built was hours duration during weekday afternoons for one week a month ago this week my husband enrolled son and our daughter age into the same provider s drone coding and flying class this one is a full day we do not need to have them attend for child care purposes our kids have said that the reality at this camp is that a lot of the time is wasted they made a last minute decision to include younger kids around age they have spent a lot of time waiting around for drone batteries to charge or getting the younger kids to pay attention and while the staff is knowledgeable and encouraging my kids feel like they would rather not attend the rest of the week daughter is the only female camper and said she felt a bit awkward yo offered to do more household chores instead in addition to his regular chores which i really appreciate because the house needs some extra cleaning attention we are expecting weekend guests the camp staff was very nice said they understood that families often have plans that change in summer and that if kids cannot attend it s fine dad husband says they have to keep going it s not far from home but is out of the way i work part time and have to go into my work site but i have a very flexible schedule so it s really not any trouble to take them or pick them up but why should they keep going they are both smart and pretty cooperative at home they are not learning much there i think when you try an activity that turns out to be mediocre as an adult you can decline to continue with it so parents should they keep going the main reason at this point is because dad says we have to i feel ok with them quitting and do not expect either child to do triple the amount of housework if they quit some extra chores yes ok but nothing extreme i don t want this to turn into a power struggle between kids and dad or my husband and i i just don t see the point in them going to a camp that is not teaching them much and that they are merely tolerating,0,0.08,0.92,0.08,0.08

adoption it s worth it i saw this elsewhere and i wanted to share with you all maybe becoming a parent the old fashioned way isn t going to happen for you age medical gender etc maybe you want to give that opportunity of a loving home family to a child that is already in the world or you re unable to handle newborn ness it s a word i used it so it s a word but have so much to give as a parent adoption isn t easy it isn t cheap it can be really complex and heartbreaking as a process because giving a loving home isn t enough right but it is worth it so consider it and if you re in process hang in there so here are a few things to consider that are very very true here are truths i have learned about adoption i wish everyone knew adoption is love although everyone s story is unique adoption means that a child is loved and wanted and adored and treasured always repeat after me adoption is love adoption also means loss regardless of how much a child is loved they have suffered a traumatic loss of their birth mother and birth family a child may mourn this loss at any time and it is important to validate these feelings they need to know that this is normal and perfectly okay to be feeling this way a birth mother is part of their story we talk about her openly and honestly and will support our daughter if and when she ever decides that she wants to find her an adopted child needs to feel connected to their culture if they were born in another country or are of a different race it is important to immerse them in their traditions so that they can have a better understanding of who they are and where they come from an adopted child is loved the same as your biological children my daughter may not have grown in my tummy but she grew in my heart and i promise you my heart swelled with so much love for my daughter when they placed her in my arms this love was no different from when i held my biological children the first time love is love there is no difference i am her real mom this is another phrase i hear a lot oh so you are not her real mom hmm i love her more than anything i take care of her when she is sick i feed her i provide clothing for her i take her to the park and to the movies and to the beach i play games with her i read books with her i wipe her tears when she is sad and kiss her good night i pray for her she holds my heart i think that qualifies me as her real mom no i am not her biological mother but that does not mean i am not her real mom i wish people would not call her my adopted child she is quite simply my daughter no need to make her feel as if she is different or branded i wish people would not use the word adopted as an insult how many times have your siblings done something obnoxious and you yell back criticizing them you must be adopted words they are powerful and this insult does not go unnoticed to those who have been adopted it makes something so beautiful seem as if it is negative and bad i cringe every time i hear this phrase because i know how it has the power to make my daughter feel different and as if she doesn t belong adoption does not mean that the birth mother did not want her child every situation is different but many times a birth mother makes the heart wrenching decision to give their child up for adoption because of their tremendous love for them it is a selfless decision to put their child s needs before their own and it is an act of great love i wish that parents would explain all of this to their children so that they will have a better understanding of what it truly means to be adopted it means love so often children make innocent comments because they just don t understand adoption and they are curious but these comments they hurt educate your children adoption is beautiful and a reflection of god s love for all of us it is truly one of our greatest blessings it is such a privilege and honor to love and raise our daughter people have told us that she is lucky to have us but they just don t understand that we are the lucky ones she has shown us the power of love and love always wins,0,0.12,0.88,0.12,0.12

how can i m help my daughter f adjust to a brand new life tw this post makes non graphic references to past sexual assault and suspected child abuse this story is pretty complicated but i ll try to keep the rundown as basic as possible i ll answer any questions if necessary when i was i entered a relationship with m then we broke up around two years later after m raped me unknown to me m got pregnant as a result of that fast forward to about months ago m reached out to me to see if we could meet for coffee i reluctantly agreed and she told me that she was dying and she only had a few months left to live she told me about my daughter e there was a big fight about custody because she had no interest in me raising e but she passed about a month and a half ago and her father signed over full custody i am of course incredibly happy to have my daughter and to be able to raise her even if the circumstances are less than ideal it s been difficult adjusting to having a child so fast but my partner m and i are doing our best while e has very quickly become attached to both of us she is obviously struggling with the loss of her mom and her family we already are working to find her a therapist but she hasn t liked any so far and we re on a few waiting lists we ll continue to shop around until she finds somebody she s comfortable with mostly however i m struggling with how to handle e s adjustment because the life she has with us is very different than her one from before while my partner and i are in the alright financial standing to raise a child m came from a wealthy family and i worry we can t provide in the same way most concerningly e is afraid of crying or being angry in front of us she won t say anything but she did tell me a few days ago that whenever she would cry her mom would get very angry so i desperately need some advice i know therapy is obviously the most important thing but there has to be something my partner and i can do in the meantime any advice on how to help her process the loss of her family and lifestyle as well as help her break the mindset of abuse would be greatly appreciated,0,0.14,0.86,0.14,0.14
yo searching inappropriate things with school computer i just got a message from the school that my child violated school technology policy with a search done at home their filter blocked it and alerted them my child did a search about masturbation i need some advice as how to handle this i am only slightly concerned about the topic but peeved that it was school administration that brought it to my attention school only just started the child knows the rules and had even spoken to me an hour or two earlier about the new filter the school uses and how too many blocked sites can get them in trouble previous year this child was frequently caught watching youtube videos on the school s device while at home they would lose use of the device at home for the rest of the day so there s history of sus activity and non compliance with the technology agreement they sign each school year school administration will be addressing it tomorrow with the child while normally i believe in separation of discipline what happens at school is addressed at school and i do not further discipline i feel like i need to do something because this occurred at home how do i get this to stop what is the best way to address this do i preparr them about what s to come tomorrow,0,0.09,0.91,0.09,0.09

what are some good books for a child to read to gain perspective i hope this question is allowed i have an year old son who is a great kid but unfortunately he has issues handling his emotions sometimes granted all kids do but he really goes to extremes he lashes out and says his life is horrible and we are bad parents hates us hates his life etc we give him everything in the world and punishment is limited to timeouts removing video games loss of privileges things like that we have contacted a child psychologist to hopefully help with this i was thinking that perhaps finding some things to give him a better perspective on life would be good so that he can learn and appreciate his situation he is being put in a gifted class next year as his test scores were off the charts so i know he is capable of critical thinking i thought the diary of anne frank would be a good start my wife recommended a child called it but i think that s too extreme for an year old do any of you have other suggestions,1,0.27,0.73,0.27,0.73
partner is losing his mind usually my partner is a very hands on parent so he definitely doesn t lack like some parents do however i can t see the reasoning behind his logic and i feel like i m crazy our one daughter just turned yrold saw the doctor at months old and after much scrutiny over her diet our doctor thinks she specifically has a cows milk protein allergy this means even lactose free milk is a no go i stopped breastfeeding completely around months if it comes from a cow she shouldn t have it she s on a milk free formula and is a picky eater so is still mostly getting her nutrition from formula she s doing much better she s not spending hours screaming and finally started sleeping through the night even or is up just for one quick feed it s awesome we have tried slowly adding milk products here and there it s fine in very small doses but it has to be minimal preferably not at all as there is nothing we can give her if she gets too much my partner is still stressed out for some reason he recently came home with lactose free milk which she still can t have the first time he brought it home i re explained why i didn t think she could have it we gave it to our other kids then he brings it home again he starts going off how she needs to be off formula and drinking milk because she s now i try to explain no she doesn t need to be off formula just once they turn you can use milk instead of but you don t have to it went in one ear and right out the other he has started slowly adding it to their bottles last night she was up screaming was up fussing and crying for about hours today he was having a minor fit going on how she needs to be allergy tested it s clearly not milk despite the fact milk is the only new thing she s had recently i don t know how to get it through his thick skull that he is the sole cause of her feeling awful he keeps giving her her allergen then acts surprised and frustrated when her stomach is upset he acts like it s the end of the world that she can t have milk products i m perfectly fine switching all of us to a milk product free diet to accommodate but he s not i swear he s losing his damn mind i don t know if i m just here to rant or looking for advice or just justification that i m not the crazy one here,0,0.03,0.97,0.03,0.03
reading all of jules verne s books chronologically hi all i recently made a post on the wrong account detailing my experiences with the first of jules verne s works the post is right here it s me though i wanted to talk about his first novel that i read weeks in a balloon i actually read this book in this edition because i used to learn french and wanted to read all these stories in the french language i still want to do that someday i just haven t rekindled my love for that language since then so i just read the english which was on the right side of the french words granted some of my experiences in this book might be a bit different due to translations but i hope the experience wasn t too different than for most others short synopsis a famous scientist goes in a balloon with his friends to cross africa and partly to confirm the findings of other scientists stuff happens there you go my thoughts i was not bored for the entire first half of this book i thought it was exciting i loved the descriptions at first and the side characters the issue for me was that halfway through the pacing gets extremely difficult to chug along through it s like the book just stops kind of the descriptions got annoying and i ended up skimming through many of those there are some action filled events but they were also hard to get through for one reason racism to break up periods of nothingness the author would have the aeronauts interact with the ground below them or have some kind of challenge to push through unfortunately some of these challenges were riddled with blatant racism africans were only thought of as cannibals savages paganists in a negative way one time one of the characters said that if he were to be eaten by a black person it would be disgraceful because they were black another time a black person jumped on the balloon and they thought it funny since the person was black to torture the frightened man by dragging him through space until he fell and there are more examples including many racist jokes i understand that this is because this is a victorian era book written by a white man i already know this even though people like to tell me as if i don t know does it mean i condone the thoughts writings relating to racism no i don t on the bright side it shows how ideology has changed for so many people throughout history until today i am continuing to read more of his books since i m hoping this theme of black people indigenous people from the short stories being treated as savages might go away maybe it won t we ll see i m slightly disappointed in that though for someone who was amazing and ahead of their time in terms of scientific inventions i was hoping that they would be ideologically more ahead than this though i know racism was and still is common i promise i did overall enjoy this book it was fun and had adventure but sometimes it felt too slow and too racist i kind of had a bad taste in my mouth reading this book especially in public and i half felt uncomfortable after reading the story even though i liked some of the characters i give this stars on the bright side i was vacationing in disney and ended my trip with a balloon ride in disney springs highly recommend,1,0.94,0.06,0.94,0.06000000000000005
i have a strange bias i first look for a review that despises a book or movie i love and vice versa for one thing those takes are oftentimes quite amusing for another perusing them serves to check the visceral initial reaction which tends to overlook flaws or strengths of a piece of work which they sometimes do a good job of putting a spotlight on or they can offer an interesting and thoughtful perspective even if you dissent from it and finally they remind you that there exist a variety of views out there some good others bad yet others subjective you don t need to conform to every single one that you come across thinking as such can reinforce a sense in you of being secure in your own opinion,1,0.97,0.03,0.97,0.030000000000000027

star wars light of the jedi a disappointing read let me start by saying that i m a die hard star wars fan i was so excited to read a new era of the star wars universe away from the skywalker saga as the title states it was a huge let down the story didn t progress in the first pages which is where i stopped reading out boredom and confusion and the author kept saying things like the song of the force in random spots that were meant to be poetic but just came off as incoherent and a half assed attempt that and other lines like he was the great greatstorm completely turned me off and actually demotivated me from continuing to read the high republic novels am i alone with this feeling does it seem like disney is just pushing out books as quickly as possible without actually trying to make well written stories,1,0.96,0.04,0.96,0.040000000000000036

airport mishap is this on me or the airport i am flying with my month old daughter from dc usa to sweden we are flying iceland air and i did not purchase her a seat instead i paid more to have her as a lap infant the flights from the us to sweden were no problem they had extra seats and i got to put her car seat in her own seat on both flights score and there were no issues bringing her stroller on either flight now i am at the stockholm airport flying back and they said the flight is full so we can t bring the car seat that s fine so we check that but then they say i can t take the stroller either chicco keyfit without the car seat inside i ask why as online it says a stroller and car seat or carrying basket are always included turns out what that means is you can check the stroller with your other bags for free not that you are allowed to gate check them apparently they don t have the employees to get it at the gate or space on the flight yet they had space on the first two flights and they re the same type of plane they said we could use their strollers but she can t sit upright yet and is too small for it they are like a degree angle and she slumps forward way too much so now i have to somehow carry her my diaper bag cooler and hospital grade double electric breast pump which weighs like lbs on the flight here i put the cooler and pump in the stroller bag did i mess this up or do the iceland air employees not know what they are talking about they also later said there were open seats on the flight but i was too tired of arguing with them at that point so i didn t mention them saying it was full earlier,0,0.16,0.84,0.16,0.16

alex michaelides the silent patient vs the maidens an exhaustive breakdown of their very similar weaknesses major spoilers i will start by saying that i understand the appeal of these novels as page turners they are easy to read and if you want a twisty reveal at the end you will probably be entertained and satisfied that being said i am confused by the widespread adoration of the silent patient and the reasonably positive reception of the maidens it s gotten mixed reviews from legit publications and mostly glowing reviews from fans of his first novel the weaknesses of the two are strikingly similar as well which tells me i should prob just stop reading stuff from this guy though i am intrigued to see whether he keeps repeating the same apparently successful patterns these books were at least super fun to hate for context i read the maidens for a bookclub i m in because several of the members had read and loved the silent patient and one of them gave me a copy of the latter to read on my own time i loathed the maidens and then read the sp for comparative purposes spoiler warning do not read on unless you ve finished both books or unless you care not for spoilers sorry if it gets a bit shouty here are the similar weaknesses i noticed in both pseudo psychology weirdly similar group therapy scenes early on where a cartoonishly unstable patient first elif and then henry arrives late disrupts the meeting by throwing something into the middle of the circle in one case a pool cue in the other a coffee and is asked to join the group after the therapist s speechify on the importance of rules and boundaries as if these therapists would know an appropriate boundary if it kicked them in the head and debate whether to allow the patient to join both scenes are so transparent in their design to establish the credibility legitimacy of the narrators as therapists but instead both theo and mariana come off as super patronizing the protagonists are less and less believable as therapists at the stories progress though at least theo s incompetence is explained away by the twist at the end mariana on the other hand is confronted in the opening pages of the novel by a patient who has self harmed pretty extensively and rather than ensure he get proper medical attention she essentially throws him a first aid kit and tosses him out the door so she can pour herself a glass of wine and call her niece and it devolves from there ongoing insistence throughout the narrative that one s childhood trauma entirely explains the warped dysfunctional way a character behaves or views the world which is why the books go out of their way to give every potentially violent character a traumatic childhood when theo insists that no one ever became an abuser who hadn t been abused themselves i wanted to throw the book across the room that is a myth sir get out of here with your armchair psychology female murderers whose pathology boils down to history of depression and traumatized by a male loved one family member because as we all know depression abuse murderer the therapy depicted in both books is so so unrealistic mostly because neither narrators function as therapists so much as incompetent detectives obsessively pursuing a case they have no place pursuing or skill to pursue both just happen across every clue mostly by way of clunky conversation with all the people who can provide precisely the snippet of info to send them along to the next person and the next until all is revealed in a twist their constant psych asides were so tiresome and weirdly dated at times also the constant harping on countertransference got so ridiculous that at one point during therapy theo literally attributes his headache and a particular emotion he feels to alicia as though the contents of her head are being broadcast directly into his mind and i m pretty sure that s not how it works characters psychotherapist narrators with abusive fathers histories of depression and pretensions of being sherlock holmes said pretensions result in both characters crossing all kinds of ethical lines as they invade the personal lives of everyone even tangentially connected to their cases and in theo s case violate all kinds of patient confidentiality yeah yeah by the end that s the least of his offenses but before you get there it s baffling that he gets so little pushback on this i ve never experienced a thriller where the investigator protagonists involvement in the main mystery is sooo tenuously justified all female characters are either elderly with hilariously bad advice monstrous hulking brutes or beautiful bimbos mean girls except for mariana who is bella swan esque in her unawareness of her own attractiveness despite multiple men trying to get with her almost immediately after meeting her i m so tired of beautiful female characters being oblivious to their own hotness are we meant to believe all mirrors and male attention have escaped their notice if it s to make them relatable this tactic really fails with me all characters of color are shallow cartoonish side characters and most of them are depicted as unsympathetic minor antagonists the sikh chief inspector in the maidens continuously drinks tea from an ever present thermos and his only other notable characteristic is his instant dislike of mariana whom he very rightly warns to stay out of the investigation that she is very much compromising the caribbean manager of the grove is universally disliked by her staff for enforcing stricter safety regulations at the bafflingly poorly run mental institution because how dare she there s a very clear vibe that we re supposed to dislike these characters and share the protagonists indignation but honestly sangha stephanie were completely in the right for trying to shut down their wildly inappropriate investigations working class characters or basically anyone excluded from the comfortably upper crust educated main cadre of characters are few and far between in both stories but when they show up he depicts them as such outlandish caricatures we get elsie the pathologically lying piggish housekeeper in the maidens who is enticed to talk with the promise of cake and then a toothless leprechaun dealing drugs under a bridge in the sp in case you missed it a man described as having the body of a child the face of father time and no front teeth emerges from beneath a bridge and offers to sell theo some grass i was dying there are no characters to root for or even feel marginally invested in anywhere partly because they re all so thinly drawn and because we re clearly supposed to view almost all of them as potential suspects so they re all creepy rude and or incompetent in some way the flimsiest of flimsy motives both for the narrators and the murderers theo fully would have gotten away with his involvement in the murder if he hadn t gone out of his way to work at the grove and treat alicia and his justification for doing so is pretty weak his rapid descent into stalking and murder fantasy and his random decision to expose alicia s husband as a cheater with a spur of the moment home invasion and staged attempted homicide is only justified if the reader hand waves it away as welp he s crazy i guess after all he did have an abusive father and a history of mental illness and in michaelides novels that s all you need to become a violent psycho i guess we re lucky mariana didn t also start dropping bodies because the logic of his fictional universe says she should definitely be a murderer by now maybe that ll be his maidens sequel but mariana especially had no reason to randomly turn detective and she kept trying to justify it by saying she needed to re enter the world or that sebastian would want her to even though she had no background in criminal psychology why were sebastian and zoe so certain she would insert herself into the investigation just because one of zoe s friends was the first victim why as for zoe and alicia their motives are mere suggestions they were both abused and manipulated and voila slippery slope to murder writing style incessant allusions to greek tragedy and myth attempt to provide a sophisticated gloss over the bare bones writing style which opts far more for telling than showing and frequently indulges in hilariously bizarre analogies credit where credit is due the references to greek myth are less clunky in the sp and i liked learning about the alcestis play myth which i hadn t heard of before but the entire characterization of fosca who we are meant to believe is a professor of greek tragedy at one of the most respected universities on the planet is just absurd his lecture on the liminal in greek tragedy is essentially the wikipedia page on the eleusinian mysteries capped off with some hallmark card carpe diem randomness the lecture hall responds with raucous applause clearly never having heard such vague genius bull before super clumsy and amateurish narrative device of interludes written by another character sebastian s letter reads like a mashup of dexter monologues and clarice s memory of the screaming sheep but by far the worse offender is alicia s diary where we re supposed to believe she painstakingly recorded entire conversations beat by beat dialogue even when she s just been drugged to the gills with morphine and has mere moments of consciousness left and even before that she takes the time to write he s trying the windows and doors someone s inside someone s inside the house etc etc when she thinks her stalker has broken in downstairs just who does that speaking of dialogue the dialogue is so stilted and unnatural based on his bio michaelides got a degree in screenwriting which makes this weakness even more baffling hilariously rendered voyeur scenes where the narrators spy on couples having sex such unintentionally awkward descriptions first we have kathy s climax sounds through the trees which i believe are simply rendered with the phrase climax sounds and then the bowler hat carefully placed on a tombstone before the gatekeeper plows a student again i died plot twist the constant red herrings make for such an exhausting read michaelides drops anvils with almost every character that are so obviously meant to designate them as suspects in our minds there is absolutely no subtlety in his misdirections the crossover scene between the sp and the maidens makes no sense when in the timeline does mariana s story overlap with theo s they confer just before theo starts working at the grove obviously though mariana appears to be the one who alerts theo to the job opening there whereas in the sp theo has been aware of alicia s location since the murder and had already planned to apply to work there but then are we supposed to believe that while theo has been psychotically pursuing his warped quest to help alicia he s also been diligently treating zoe so invested in her case that he repeatedly reaches out to mariana to get her to visit zoe and even writes mariana a lengthy letter to convince her to do so and then a couple days after the maidens ends theo is arrested but the thing i really did hate the most is how michaelides treats his female murderers who are both also victims themselves as mere means to deploy a twist there s no moment spared to encourage our sympathy for zoe who was groomed and manipulated by the only trusted father figure in her life and even after spending a decent amount of time getting to know alicia via her ridiculous diary where it s so apparent that she s been demeaned objectified manipulated gaslit and or used by every man in her life she s sent packing to spend the rest of her days in a coma how much more satisfying would it have been for her to succeed in exposing theo and reclaiming her voice but no she basically rolls over when he comes to finish her off speaking of are there no security cameras in this ward for the criminally insane writes one last diary entry in great detail and drifts off forever and then a couple pages of nothing later the story is over bye alicia both books kept me rolling throughout by which i mean eye rolling but also rotfl maybe i will check out his next effort i m morbidly curious what he ll turn out it does leave me wondering whether i should give up on thriller novels entirely though are many of the weaknesses of these novels just characteristic of the genre maybe i m just holding these books to unfair standards i m mostly only familiar with thriller films many of which i think are amazing but maybe you can get away with more in a film than you can in a novel i really only intended to write a handful of bullet points but more and more kept coming to mind as i wrote to the point where subheadings became necessary whoopsie,1,0.93,0.07,0.93,0.06999999999999995

tribute to the local bookseller of my childhood please feel free to share your own experiences we all have those special bookstores i hope the ones from before amazon wrecked them all i m not a luddite but i do have a soft spot for a place where you can come in browse for hours maybe even sit and read enough preamble here s my favorite when i was or around or a new book store opened up in my town there already was one bookseller an independent shop that dealt only in new titles susan s books was different she carried all sorts of books her model worked in a way that was novel to me all books were on sale for half the cover price unless they were really in bad shape but the real deal was that she would take your books in as inventory and give you store credit for a quarter of the cover price my family were all voracious readers so when the shop opened we brought in dozens of titles i think we ended up with something like in store credit and most of that was from books that we d gotten cheap at garage sales susan only charge you a quarter for each credit transaction once you were done with the book if you didn t feel like keeping it you could just bring it back to her for more credit her shop was open for about or years before she sold her inventory to powell s and retired that initial burst of credit kept us in books for the entire time from susan i got into ian fleming frank herbert philip k dick and so many others i read enough books that i ve forgotten most of them to be honest susan s shop felt like a second home i d walk or bike a few miles every day in the summer to just spend an hour or two browsing shelves and then buy a few books sometimes i d stay and read in her sitting section other times we d just chat susan only ever had one employee at a time for a long time it was a high school girls named kelly i think i thought she was so cute and smart that i would awkwardly chat her up for hours at a time kelly if you ever read this i m the weird autistic kid who wouldn t stop talking sorry about that anyway i really valued that store it was so great to be able to just look for a book not knowing what you wanted and find something that felt like it was destined to be yours after susan retired another shop opened up in town and it used the same model it was a bit bigger and the women who ran it were nice i had like in credit when i moved away so i just transferred it to my friends who ended up becoming my in laws a few years later all of the stores in that town are closed now i still have powell s nearby or cameron s if i want something more independent though i can t stand how cameron s stacks their shelves but i ll always miss susan and her little shop,1,0.64,0.36,0.64,0.36
death of the author is a literary analysis approach not a thought terminating clich lately i have most often seen death of the author used synonymously with platitudes like you gotta separate the artist from the art thrown around in culture war nonsense on the defensive side of whether this or that book is problematic which is a shame because the original literary theory as started by roland barthes is pretty fascinating on it s own right by which of course i don t mean that it is correct we are talking about literary criticism here not physics or math there is no such thing as a correct academic model that you are supposed to favor over all others most people don t sem to be all that self aware about the different schools of thought that go into for example a review that describes what a book that you read without ever looking up it s author meant to you and a review that praises a literary classic as it s creator s magnum opus or for changing history or even just reading a new author s second book and praise the skill improvements since the first one you can either go out of your way to only see a book as your own personal experience or as an object in context of a history and an artist s career for example if you read huckleberry finn and you also decide to research the antebellum south s history and mark twain s politics and the public commentary he made elsewhere and appreciate the book s apparent message as a product of it s time that s an act in defiance of the death of the author approach ironically enough someone who decides to ignore all of that context or someone who is naturally ignoarnt of it opens the book sees a sentence using the n word and immediately get offended is practicing a crude form of death of the author analysis i don t care what this mark guy originally meant by this or what a nice guy he was to me in it feels insulting h p lovecraft is another infamous example where the usual defenders of problematic classics would probably be better off appealing to more context than to less researching his life s history in any capacity one might confirm that he was a huge bigot sure but also that both of his parents died in asylums and that the threat of inferiority or madness lurking in one s own heredity was something very intimately horrifying to him not just a racial thing in contrast anyone invited to simply read a story like the shadow over innsmouth while consciously ignoring any authorial context could still easily come to the conclusion that even on a first read it sounds transparently like some sort of allegory about race mixing which is of course a limitation of death of the author we might choose not to read or to ignore interviews that the author made right after publishing a book explainging what it s message was and we can choose not to read their wikipedia biography and psychoanalize them but we are still living in the world we are familiar with it s politics and moral agendas with tropes and coding and we won t be entirely blind to the idea that books usually have messages and themes choosing not to indulge in speculation over what the author s original ones might have been isn t the same thing as not reading anything into them,1,0.81,0.19,0.81,0.18999999999999995

i feel like i need to vent a bit about local woman missing by mary kubica this is the first book i read by mary kubica after having enjoyed gillian flynn books amp x b some spoilers amp x b the first part really drew me in i though she wrote this really well i was in the mind of this girl feeling like i couldn t bear to read a whole book from the perspective of her in captivity i did enjoy the book for a while trying to figure out what was going on but the longer it went the more i struggled first there are so many twists for the sake of twists meredith has no idea why someone would send her threatening texts which are not even really threatening but then later reveals that she and marty have a secret at that point we have no reason to think she is an unreliable narrator and she proves not to be that and then the reveal of the secret are just there to create a false twist same with leo and the bully and then the power outage they are there to create false tension and this plot already has so many twists it s unbelievable that so many related events happen anyway but i can at least suspend that unbelief second speaking of believability some of the actions and choices make no sense the couple in michael il has an unbelievable motive and their decision to come back to their house defies all credibility meredith s failure to have a rational thought at all when it comes to bea maybe the panic the night of the accident but not the confrontation in the garage or the failure to have the hotel clerk call or the understanding that nothing good could come from obeying bea in the hotel also there is no way the autopsy wouldn t find a hammer blow to the head or any defensive wounds you can t surprisingly slit someone s wrists like a suicide attempt shelby s autopsy would show she d been hit by a car and while they never go into details there they would find jason s car s undamaged they would also find the texts she exchanged on the way to her hookup basically everyone involved with the investigations including the woman cop is dumb there were a few spots where i felt like wow is this how a woman thinks which i took to be a good part of a woman writing women however she fails to give any character any personality except for leo and being bullied and resentful isn t a personality the characters blur they are all vapid people just reacting with concern to troubling things it felt like a stereotype of suburban life maybe if we got some view from bea s perspective we d have more texture but kate and meredith are really just bland reporters of events finally there was an incredibly preachy section about doctors and consent i spoke with my wife and she has not felt like she was railroaded at all during three births i know there really are proven concerns about doctors ignoring women s pain and symptoms but if you fake a pregnancy to meet a doctor another stupid decision that makes no sense i can t go along with the portrayal of sexual assault because he is brusque about it i ve had invasive procedures as a man and just because a doctor has poor beside manner doesn t make me an assault victim i will give another book by her a try but i felt like i needed to say this and i don t know anyone else who has read the book,1,0.86,0.14,0.86,0.14

teenage motivation hi sorry for the length of this but i feel some background is necessary we have a teenage child who is pretty bright they also have a passion for one school subject which they hope to follow to university level however it ll lead them into an extremely competitive career space with a lack of marketable skills in other areas that said they ve got talent and we feel it s important to give them the chance to follow their dream while we encourage them to leave a safety net in place however they ve come to this decision partly because they cannot conceive of doing a job they find in any way difficult or boring which is not the most mature reasoning for most of their teen years they ve done well at school getting very good grades in most subjects in the previous year however their attitude toward school has gone extremely sour they ve lost motivation to do any studying at all and seem to actively despise all but three of their school subjects all our attempts to help have been rebuffed this isn t just pandemic blues the attitude has been in decline for a long time but they ve been able to get away without working because they re bright we decided that by this age we could no longer make them do things and knowing they had a set of mock exams at the end of the year we thought we d let them approach it as they wish the thinking was they d either do well or learn from the experience they didn t do a lot of work and we were not allowed to check or be involved with the bulk of the work they allegedly carried out the reality was a lot worse than we d expected they did well in the three subjects they enjoy but dreadfully across the board in the rest and when i say dreadful i mean plummeting from quite high grades to fails they chose to interpret this as evidence that they are not academic after all we sat them down and talked about the experience and we got them to commit to a series of changes in how they d approach study things like accepting more parental intervention studying outside their bedroom where they can be checked making notes they d previously rejected even the need for organization or study skills and spending more time on it some weeks later now that it s time to put this into practice it s causing huge friction they remain unmotivated and unwilling to spend any time or effort on academic work what small amounts of time are grudgingly spent are seen as working very hard and there is enormous upset when we suggest more is needed there s no willingness to go beyond the curriculum at all even something moderately engaging like reading a novel all they want to do is spend time with their friends either in person or online they still have big plans to try and take their favored subject forward to university but with only three decent grades at secondary level they won t even get to the next level of education never mind college i honestly also don t think they realize that to succeed in such a competitive area will require a lot of hard effort they seem to have no concept of what trying hard really means we ve tried explaining this tried to motivate them positively tried to offer money for improvements in exam grades but nothing has worked they re running out of time now and honestly it makes me really sad to see such and intelligent child so wholly disinterested in any academic achievement at all what on earth can we do to try and motivate them and engage them in their education,0,0.47,0.53,0.47,0.47

i just finished klara and the sun i actually started klara right after i finished never let me go and it was very interesting to see how they shared similarities and how they differed overall i really enjoyed the book i do think it s the kind of book that would benefit from a second reading at some stage as i felt like i spent a lot of time trying to figure out what was going on like when klara s vision saw everything in boxes i was confused at first or the reference to oblongs or the shops shelf being in the barn of course as i read on i began to understand better but i think i d like to read it again unencumbered by that previous confusion i had like nlmg this book left me feeling a wide mix of emotions and of course i started thinking deeply about what it means to love our relationships with one another and the effect rapid modernisation is having on us and the world klara was so determined to save josie and to also be there to help everyone the best that she could i understand she s an af and is programmed to do so but her love for josie felt so genuine and real i loved klara as our narrator it was fascinating seeing the world through her eyes so the fact that a lot of stuff isn t explained in the book does make sense as we understand and see what klara does it s then up to us to try and fill in the gaps i think there are some things i don t quite understand that perhaps i m not seeing was the fathers job replaced with an af or by a person who was genetically modified or lifted why does he have to live with certain people and what are communities at what point did genetic modification even begin and had it happened to the parents too does josie actually lose some of her humanity by being generically altered remember ricks reference to always trying to find someone like her before she changed i m so fascinated by the world klara lives in that i m itching to know way more about it and would love to hear people s thoughts on it as i m sure i m just not seeing the subtext also a scene that stuck with me was klara s final visit to the barn where she examined the sheets of glass stacked against one another and saw how the sun s face and expression changed from being foreboding on the outside to being softer and more welcoming on the inner sheets i definitely felt like this was a reflection perhaps on people how we can have hard exteriors in fact quite like the mother but if you go deeper there is more to us than that and we can be better understood that way it seems to hark back to mr calpaldi claiming there is nothing within us that s so deep that it can t be replicated exactly by technology nothing that makes us so unique but klara eventually believes that that is not the case i understand that she technically had the best ending as she completed her task successfully and was granted her slow fade but i couldn t help but be heartbroken for her at the end of the book it s like a harsh reminder that klara while once a member of the family is a machine and like all machines they wear down and are replaced the book just makes it hard to view her like that because we get to know her and her thoughts and it just does not feel right when she was spending a lot of time in the utility room it made me so so sad overall i felt like it was a really strong book ishiguro really is a master of his art it s incredible the way he carries the plot through klara s eyes i would love to hear other people s thoughts too,1,0.76,0.24,0.76,0.24

the fantasy series that helped my depression what books helped yours i won t go into detail but the last months have been rather tough for me i ve been spiraling in and out of depression doing all that i can to claw my way back out like many of you i read to escape and went looking for a series that might bring some amount of happiness to my day i came across a reddit post suggesting the gems of elsana series by christian sterling labeled as a fun indie fantasy series seeing that it was free with ku i figured why not i am so f ing glad i picked up this series the gems of elsana was everything i needed in a rather dark time of my life humor wit excitement warm and fuzzies it was all there it was like fantasy comfort food the plot follows the origin story of a young wizard destined to be a legend think young gandalf dumbledore who sets off on a classic fantasy quest which his team of champions the first book in the series starts off in the standard fantasy setting subverting a trope here and there until the plot takes them to more unconventional settings with increasingly bizarre characters i don t want to spoil too much but i loved every chapter is it perfect no it s an indie series so it has moments that are a little rough around the edges but the story itself outshines most works released by a major publishing house i found myself desperate to escape to elsana after a rather bad day the positive messages silly banter and outright ridiculous situations truly brightened my day a recurring theme throughout the series is that adventures aren t really adventures unless there are struggles along the way and i guess that s what i keep reminding myself life is an adventure and i ve just got to battle through my struggles right now whether you like fantasy or not and you just need a pick me up series to read i highly recommend these books for you with all that being said i d love to hear your favorite books that brighten your day as well,1,0.84,0.16,0.84,0.16000000000000003

do you prefer longer or shorter book titles ever since i started reading i found myself much more drawn to books with longer book titles so long and thanks for all the fish this is how you lose the time war etc something about the title being so specific and elaborate while also staying really abstract gives it this bizarreness that intrigues me enough to want to pick up the book more in contrast books with shorter names like the hike vicious and so on just don t give me that feeling much what do you think,1,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
the glory and the dream a masterpiece over the past and look into the future i recently got interested in autobiographies biographies and history based novels probably because of or probably because of the gloomy future of and beyond then i started reading the glory and the dream i expected the glory and the dream to be boring and dragging yet it is interesting fast paced and very informative it did such a fantastic portraying historical figures they were vivid and live deep from the bottom of my heart i resonate and sympathize with the commoners farmers and workers this is such a brilliant book that i can barely put it down it definitely gives me a new perspective over what had happened during is an accumulation of what had happened way before you can t change by changing but maybe the changes made in can have an impact in every historical event is like a water drop in a river together they are the river yet they are forced to move where the river leads,1,0.92,0.08,0.92,0.07999999999999996

appreciation post for the bobiverse i listened to the audiobook years ago but felt a need to restart it the first book is called we are legion we are bob for those not in the know i m on chapter of the first book but i m more aware of how much it explores well being a person i wanted to go back to it because it s super fun and just well has fun with a sci fi setting but i forgot how strong the themes were it tends to make an enemy of religion at least at first but many of the explored themes have made me question what the author s take is something i ve started paying attention to because it can make for heavy handed storytelling but i ve also seen highly religious authors that don t make their worldview the focus of the story i d assume his basically atheist protagonist is reflective of his view but he very quickly questions whether or not souls exist and if he s the same person he was before and the writing really feels like you re in this snarky software engineer s head taylor knows what he s writing and i honestly forgot how well ray porter does the voices for the audiobook what are your thoughts,1,0.97,0.03,0.97,0.030000000000000027

co parenting difficulties hey folks i m in need of some perspectives here i m not even sure on where to begin but basically i m getting beyond frustrated at my ex partners attitude towards work it seems to be his absolute top priority to the point where its effecting my life and plans and i m concerned how our year old is going to be percieving feeling about it growing up i never want him to see what i do that work will always come first and we re all expected to cater to it i dont want my son believing work is life s sole purpose either he s told me in the past that he only had days off in a month and then goes on to tell me that he s actually being underpaid currently too he hasn t brought this up to his boss because she s going through a hard time for the last years that s life though huh this has also meant that apparently he can t afford fuel to drop our son somewhere convenient for me despite the fact its never been a problem before he also refuses to even entertain looking at another job because he can t get paid that much anywhere else however i will mention that he is atrocious with his finances literally drove me into debt for the first time ever previously so i m reckoning it s not so much pay as it is lack of financial skills if they spring a surprise shift extra hours etc he always agrees without hesitation or complaint im talking about a hour shift with less than hours notice even when he has his kid he also likes to leave at least an hour early for work this means that not only on his days is his mum looking after our son even when i think its his dad but he often messages me last minute the morning of or the night before to change drop off times if i kick up a fuss and say i need more notice or i m not there at that time he tells me i m not being fair when i kick off about it especially as he does so much for me i dont understand why he only tells me these things last minute or just expects me to work my life and plans around his job this especially comes up at the end of a week where my partner is visiting we re away together what s even worse is his willing lack of communication so even when they let him know he doesn t tell me straight away this is not the way he sees it i honestly don t think he understands that work is a choice and that he has a choice in his work he was in the forces before we met and i ve mentioned he has a soldier mentality towards work that s no longer being a soldier he agreed yet doesnt remotely change if his job was something like a police officer or paramedic etc i would understand but it s literally a standard job in a tiny place that s not remotely fundamental and hes the only member of staff with a kid yet spends the most amount of time there he ll go down to wait for stock to arrive apparently for hours yet doesn t clock these hours in or even ask someone else who is free and has the time lives closer to do it can someone please help me understand this insane mentality towards a supposedly temporary job would any of you happily work hour weeks underpaid whilst simultaneously saying you want to spend more time with your kid i would never dream of making him work around my boss last minute shift changes especially without my prior knowledge or consent i would tell them no sorry i have my son i need more notice am i in the minority should work be his our priorities tldr ex partner is happy being overworked and underpaid and expects me to work around his job but wishes he could spend more time with his kid,0,0.04,0.96,0.04,0.04

a lesson in judging a book by its cover deadly silence spoiler warning i m gonna talk about plot stuff i came upon deadly silence by rebecca zanetti in the most innocent of ways aimlessly walking trough a discount book store while putting off the real reason i had come to the mall that day buying shoes they had hardcover copies on display in three places a quick glance at the back cover gave me a nearly forty year old man the impression this was a tale not too far removed from the hard boiled detective genre this dear readers was a bold faced lie a deception of the grandest order one may go so far as to call it a scooby doo villain in disguise had i taken a few moments to read the first chapter in the store i still would have fallen victim to this bait and switch i was introduced to the male lead of the story ryker who i permanently visualized as a young jonathan frakes at the body dump of the latest victim of serial killer the copper killer the mo of our practically forgotten for the rest of the book plot device is that target red haired woman that related to members of law enforcement a momentary thought is given to our leads brother before he moves along chapter two introduces the female lead zara a paralegal that clearly slept through the ethics sections of whatever course work is required to get such a job she eagerly awaiting her lover ryker wearing her sexiest lingerie and having prepared a lasagna for him their romantic interlude is quickly ruined when he spies a poorly concealed bruise on her face and he turns into captain caveman demanding to know how it happened now these two are not a long involved couple simply casual mutual sexual gratification for each other zara noticing the flashing red flag kicks him out and attempts to end the relationship and here is where i realized what kind of story i really in for now i m not going to lie i almost stopped listening to the audiobook when ryker basically told her i m going to let you sleep on it and think about if that s really what you want i would have regretted it though instead i shifted how i interpreted it and got my mental popcorn bucket ready because a train wreck was just over the horizon at no point did our supposed hero become likable ever not even after the revelation of his and by extension of the male cast tragic background now let s look at the mess zara has made for herself aside from her lover that is her lawyer boss is representing the town mayor in his divorce proceedings zoe s dated the mayor back when his daddy was the mayor and introduced him to her gal pal and happily became the third wheel as those two fell for each other during the divorce work zara has been loaning the soon to be ex wife roughly eight thousand dollars over three months and giving advise on what she should be doing in response to the mayors legal moves predictably this will bite zara in the ass when her friend turns up dead through the magic of burner phones zara is roped back into rykers spell under the threat of a dive bar owner telling her come get your man or i have him arrested zara displays her superior critical thinking skills and brings him back to her home she snopes through his belongings a discovers he multiple phones each with a single contact saved to them thank god he did drop the fbi phone during his bar fight a sobered up ryker heads to his new office home and we meet his brothers from maybe different biological sources denver the tech guy that leaves his if anyone finds this information we are so fucked files on a networked computer and keith the lawyer the computers do get hacked and those files do get found turns out the brothers are on the run from a small town sherif and and crazy scientist that i guess helped co write the kurt russel movie soldier ryker pays a visit to zara s work place and pressures her into telling him how she got the bruise on her face and promptly makes like a caveman to pay the perpetrator back for damaging his property i wish i was making that up and it won t be the only thing i say that about let s talk about the sex i ll try to keep it brief even though it s like of the book no kink shaming but holy shit i think zara only actually agrees to sex twice but she does she orgasms so hard her womb convulses around ryker there is a lot of dom sub theme to the sex including the time he attempts to have risky public sex with her that she wasn t down for look for that to happen in book two i guess the logical ending point for the story is shortly after the murder of zara s friend is sorted out a mystery that the reader has zero chance of figuring out ryker let s his penis do too much of his thinking to figure it out for himself what chance does the reader have the copper killer angle is left unresolved and i m going to take wild guess and say that they have the same relationship to ryker that most of the cast introduced late in the book do resulting in much internal emotional drama for ryker the change in how i processed the story allowed me to get to the end of the book both where the story should have ended and where it finally stopped,1,0.64,0.36,0.64,0.36

destructive playing i have no idea if this is a commonly known concept but it s what i ve come to call it i used to nanny for some kids the older two being and i always thought it was abnormal that they wouldn t sit down and build things when that s a lot of what i remember doing as a kid the oldest got this awesome star wars lego set for christmas and i was tasked with putting it together with him cool right except he had no patience or interest in trying to build it he simply wanted to watch me put parts of it together so he could then smash it to pieces again the same thing when we got lincoln logs i was so excited because those were my favorite toys as a kid but they both just wanted the buildings done for them so they could then come over and knock them down i attributed this at the time to all their electronics and that they just didn t have the attention span or patience for manual building maybe it s just not fun in comparison to roblox either way i was pretty sure my future kids wouldn t be that way now fast forward many years i have a year old he suddenly loves pulling things off shelves opening drawers and dumping out bins he ignores his toys in favor of taking apart the remote unplugging the router and turning off the washing machine while it s mid cycle everything he does right now is destructive while all these carefully picked out toys sit there and he fights me to go through the recycling bin again i am reminded of those kids that i once took care of and thought were developmentally atypical i guess my question here is do all kids do this are there certain exploratory phases they go through and does this mean he won t eventually learn to sit down and play with intention and how can i encourage focused play and an attention span should i do more to limit his area we have gates and a playpen but he cries when confined so he s basically able to free roam that way he will be forced to entertain himself with what s available tl dr year old prefers dismantling everything over intentional play with his toys normal,0,0.09,0.91,0.09,0.09

you re drunk i had to adopt my niece last year becoming an instant single working parent to a then yo now she s really great all things considered especially with the death of her mom but we had a really challenging week this week i think some emotions are coming through in weird ways related to the death mixed in with normal pre teen mood fluctuations dropping her off at camp this morning was awful i got to absorb all of her frustrations getting out of the car tired trouble putting on cleats dropped her gatorade i actually drove away in tears wondering what the hell my life was now i had been childfree and now i get bombarded with eye rolls and attitude it s like all the sudden having a weird roommate who rips chip bags open all the way from top to bottom and lies about weird shit like if she ate an apple or not i m not used to this i was feeling incredibly discouraged when she sent me a really sweet text saying that she was sorry for being a turd i didn t necessarily have one of those magical this is worth it parent moments but it was close it did melt my cold jaded heart a bit but flash forward to tonight after feeling good and like we had redeemed our bad week i needed help with a shortcut on the ipad and called her into the living room she chastised me for it being a simple task and said geez you re drunk and walked away wtf how do i respond to that it s friday i had a long week of working and shuttling her to camp an hour each way and yes i had drinks over hrs in my own damn home i m not drunk i m not out with my friends and my defunct social life it was a total mind fuck i mean i m not stone cold sober so is she right but i ve had less than drink per hour as i ve puttered around the house and watched the olympics the ipad failure was due to me being exclusively a laptop enthusiast if i m going to drink a little bit extra on a friday night to blow off some steam from the work week tween hell hole i think i did this the correct way full disclosure her mom was an alcoholic i m trying the approach of having honest and open conversations about it discussing what responsible moderation versus excess looks like and by trying to take the excitement out of it by being casual in the hopes that she won t run off and try it behind my back the first chance that she gets but i guess only time will tell i opted not to say anything about it i ve been told to choose my battles my gut reaction is to lash out at her for her ignorance and disrespect but i bit my tongue not sure how to proceed now,0,0.09,0.91,0.09,0.09
reading the first foundation book here are my thoughts i like the overall story and the complex and space politics witch are very intriguing and entertaining but i dislike the main characters the main character in the first of the five stories is just a vessel for the reader to experience the rest of the first sory witch i enjoyed and had no problems with the main character in the second and third stories was a total mary sue with him always being right everything always going his way he never looses and has no flaws but he was charismatic and i enjoyed the plot of these stories so i didn t mind the fourth story was short and i didn t really develop any thoughts on it s main character but the main character of the fifth story absolutely sucks he s pretty much the same as the one from stories and but without the charisma and the fifth story feels like the longest one i didn t check the length so i really hope that the plot with all the space politics remains interesting enough for me to want to finish it overall i am loving foundation,1,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

what is the history of the sidestories and multiple narratives at some point in literary history we went from here s the entire uninterrupted life of gilgamesh to james corey s the expanse where every chapter seems like a new character s pov and individual plot at some point the relationship between story and plot a bit more complicated what is the history of telling different stories at once i m talking about meanwhiles like the odyssey where suitors loiter around odysseus amp penelope s home only so odysseus can return home and kick ass later inconsequential b plots like futurama s fry explores the moon and also amy looks for her keys where they only reconvene at the veeeeery end of the show just so it has closure different voices whose stories are building towards the overarching plot again the expanse book was just miller chapters and holden chapters book was the earth group and the rocinante group book is four different voices in four different places i m scared that it s just gonna scale until every chapter is a brand new character for cartoons i think it s pretty straightforward the exec says the show needs to be minutes this week so how about homer starts a telemarketing scam but we take it in stride so there has to be a historical precedent for it how far back to multiple narratives go are there many examples of non contigent side stories in classical literature or meanwhile back at the ranch plots in ancient epics,1,0.7,0.3,0.7,0.30000000000000004

does anyone else not like books that heavily feature social media i ve always struggled to enjoy books set in a time post i used to think this was because i wanted pure escapism from things associated with my teens adult life i ve even linked my taste in scifi and fantasy to be linked to this but i ve always read some contemporary fiction too after a spate of listening to stuff based in the th and st century i think my aversion is specifically to social media and to a lesser extent instant messaging whenever a book mentions facebook instagram twitter or similar i disconnect as soon as characters are thinking about follower counts likes or retweets i detach from the story it also irks me when a story problem could be resolved by one contact texting another but it just so happens that one of them has no reception or the other person has turned their phone off oddly this isn t a problem if social media the internet plays a small role for example brief references to using a niche chat room or forum i also don t mind if the story is specifically examining social media such in some short scifi fiction does anyone else feel this,1,0.93,0.07,0.93,0.06999999999999995

need some advice about moving to a new city with a year old girl so my wife and i finally realized a dream of ours a few months back we sold our home of years which we had raised one daughter to age in and raised another one to age following that our dream was to sell the home pay everything we could off keep the rest for a new home near the beach and we did that being as how we both work from home and it s been that way for several years we felt it was the right time except for one detail we wanted to be sure of before we jumped how would a year old girl deal with being in a new place new friends new home so forth fortunately the move was only about miles south so family has come around and visited a good deal so far especially her older sister who is in college and has the time to come and stay it s been great with people here as we are only slowly getting to know our neighbors who are all great so far we noted about weeks ago that our year old started to withdraw she has started spending most of her time in her room quiet hanging out with her year dachshund nary a peep we have both been trying to engage in conversation with her to get her to open up a bit my wife is quite certain that this summer just after the move south our year girl also seemed to have her first period as well now i ve raised a daughter before and i recall that change in her demeanor following that event but to me this feels rather extreme we are talking about a kid that was always hanging out with us eager to go and do things with us and enjoy life lots of smiles lots of eagerness to be out and about now not at all sat down to dinner last night after her first day at the new school we attempted to pull conversation out of her and got very little we asked questions about the first day how the teachers were so forth not much of anything so i m asking for the experience of others who have moved a tween or pre tween we stayed in the last home for years raised one from pre school into her junior year of college didn t want to move her but this was the time or so we thought and not to wait another year for high school to start any advice for a father who misses his youngest s vibrant smiles and zeal for life,0,0.11,0.89,0.11,0.11

non fiction books that significantly change your life in a pragmatic way i m not sure if that title makes sense but i m curious to hear about non fiction books that drastically changed your ability to do something or your knowledge about a topic the reason i m asking is because i read drawing on the right side of the brain by betty edwards and almost magically became able to draw afterwards i read the back mechanic by stuart mcgill and suddenly fixed chronic back issues and then felt that back pain had been largely demystified these books are in entirely different fields art health but in both cases they dramatically changed my life and took little time to read although both books sort of have cult followings they re not by big name publishers and aren t things you d easily have jump out at you in a bookstore this has led me to think about what other similar books are out there ones that you read and wish you feel you d have benefited from reading far earlier in your life hope that makes sense suggestions welcome,1,0.93,0.07,0.93,0.06999999999999995
step parent struggling too nuclear i need help my stepson is and getting increasingly bold in the way he talks to his dad and i our childhoods were a little different and my parents were more no nonsense than his so that has naturally created differences in our parenting perspectives he is more accepting of things i view as disrespectful like jokingly flipping us the bird telling us not asking that he s going to his brother s after just being grounded constantly asking why abc thing matters puffing his chest when he s mad etc as a result and because i know me being his stepparent only makes things worse i do not get involved in discipline in front of my stepson unless i m directly involved like stepson is disrespectful to me personally he is generally a good kid but incredibly stubborn and at his age he feels he s right about everything it s been getting worse and worse and my husband is at his limit now too we cover everything except his spending money to hang out with friends he wrecked his car we got him a new one his phone was acting up new one i feel like continuing to do these things when he doesn t feel like he has to be respectful or even try to understand our frustration is just enabling the behavior we ve tried talking it out we ve tried grounding and it doesn t really help for long unfortunately i think a lack of consequences earlier in life are what got us here but that s another can of worms we are considering telling him that if he continues to feel like he can be disrespectful to us he will need to cover these sort of non necessity costs himself it was my idea and i don t fully trust my perspective because i don t have kids of my own and i know that my own overly reactive parents affect my view i m concerned that this option may be too nuclear and if so what the heck we can do please help,0,0.08,0.92,0.08,0.08

do high functioning children people actually suffer from an asd diagnosis i am m and have asd i am considered high functioning hate that term but don t know how else to describe it but i am also disabled due to comorbidity with several other mental and physical conditions i was not diagnosed until adulthood due to medical neglect from my parents getting diagnosed with asd as an adult has been one of the hardest things i ve been through my year old daughter has been showing early signs since she was young including speech delay social difficulties especially with peers and struggling with emotional regulation she is also high functioning and her doctors keep echoing all of the excuses that were used to keep me from getting help she s coping well enough it could be anxiety or something else and most triggering of all it can be more harmful to be diagnosed when you are high functioning i m struggling to understand this train of thought not getting diagnosed as a child kept me from getting therapies and support that could have changed my entire outlook on life i could have learned so much with early intervention instead of continuing to struggle to catch up on social and coping skills as a year old man my parents might have been more compassionate toward me when i struggled in school if they had received education and support themselves the list is endless outside of stigma i do not see any logic to this argument and i want to do my best to ensure that my daughter s needs are met i know that my daughter is not me and i don t want to project my struggle into her at the same time i m not comfortable with how her providers are responding to my concerns when she was her speech delay was minimized by her pcp it wasn t until she was three and couldn t use any words with intention that they started to take her case seriously we have seen a few different providers since then but the pattern is the same am i in the wrong i am scared that she will not be given help until she has suffered harm but a little part of me is also realizing that she isn t likely to go through what i did just because i am more aware than my parents were and i am not neglecting her the way that i was neglected i d also just really like to hear different perspectives on whether it is helpful to be diagnosed or not especially if someone can offer a flip side where it truly was harmful to receive a diagnosis,0,0.07,0.93,0.07,0.07

i just finished dead men walking and i m shocked so before finishing dead men walking i had read or warhammer novels but this one was just amazing first of all i loved how we had different perspectives on the story in the last two guardsmen novels that i read it was always from the perspective of one soldier but this time we had the point of view three or four different characters and how they were coping with war the fight scenes were amazing and you could really feel how big of a threat the necrons actually are and how unprepared the humans are i loved how it actually showed that men of krieg are not robots and from time to time they do show emotions it s just that the propaganda has affected them so much that they have become war machines but the one thing that really surprised me was the ending i was very surprised to see that everything was over just like that they left billions of people to be massacred i did not expect that to happen and honestly up until the very last page i was waiting for something to happen but there were no titans or space marines or miracles just like real wars sometimes things are just over and sacrifices have to be made,1,0.96,0.04,0.96,0.040000000000000036

why do people so tirelessly defend hitting children i am and all my friends who were hit with belts slapped by their parents and even punched at home as a child act as if they are somehow better than everyone who wasn t hit they think if you weren t hit as a child that makes you a weak individual and i just find it funny because countless studies show that it s actually quite the opposite mentally speaking those who were hit as a child are much more likely to suffer from mental disorders and yet people try to justify hitting their kids by saying it makes them more disciplined and stronger but from what i noticed is that my friends who did get hit a lot were just super secretive and hid a ton of bad things from their parents meanwhile i never got hit and was a good kid and didn t hide things from my parents because i had nothing to hide,0,0.14,0.86,0.14,0.14

discussion on the catcher in the rye spoiler free hi i m sure discussions about this book have already been held on reddit too many times but that isn t stopping me i have just finished j d salinger s catcher in the rye and my head is filled with thoughts when it comes to my opinion on the book i truly have mixed feelings i m not sure how to grasp them yet for personal reasons and how i related to holden s frustrations and his view on the world made me really feel for his character and was probably what i enjoyed most about the book also the irony that he called literally anyone who wasn t his sister a phony and fake while still being pretty much exactly that himself was brilliant in my opinion otherwise it felt sort of bland at times i might just be too much of a pessimist before reading this book i had heard of so many people claiming this book had forever changed them while i obviously can t deny that that was the case for these people that wasn t the case for me at all i felt for holden i understood his frustration i also tend to dislike most people i meet and have trouble meeting authentic people i genuinely admire but that was about it for me i guess what i m saying is i expected a lot more from this book that i unfortunately never got to experience since finishing this book i have read countless reviews on it and i am incredibly fascinated by how different view people have on it this seems to be a book you either hate love or just find boringly mediocre it s about a book so there cannot be an objectively correct answer which makes it all the more fascinating to me so what i want to ask is what did you think about this book did it change you in some way and if so how no spoilers please otherwise all opinions are welcome of course,1,0.96,0.04,0.96,0.040000000000000036

master and commander by patrick o brian i found many things to love about this novel and other things that tested my patience o brian s erudition shines throughout the story not in a pedantic manner but creating a sense of credibility and immersion that i rarely see in historical fiction these characters feel human with their virtues and foibles but also they talk and think as people from their time rather than modern people somehow transported back in time there s also depth to them at least to the main characters the relationship and friendship between the two main characters is of course the heart of the story captain jack aubrey and physician and naturalist stephen maturin does this friendship ring true if this were a romance we might say that aubrey and maturin have too little in common maturin is much more learned except in naval matters intelligent and sensitive aubrey is an excellent seaman vigorous and with lust for life but he s not maturin s equal intellectually aubrey is watson to maturin s holmes although in this case watson is the leader can such a friendship be fulfilling for maturin perhaps it can because sometimes people have chemistry no matter how little in common they may have o brian handles this skilfully never telling us how it is between these two but allowing us to see it in the time they spend together in the conversations and the silences they share the writing style is readable but the vocabulary is challenging the writer drowns us with naval terms and to be honest it sometimes felt like it was too much to the point that it will be a deal breaker for some readers you have to allow it to flow around you and enjoy the immersion without trying to understand every word you can sense that these characters would have probably talked this way but it is not really necessary for us to learn the name of every sail and every single naval term even without understanding all the words you always get the gist of what is happening and the book rewards your effort and patience the plot is rather episodic we follow the sophie and her crew in their missions and they might be escorting a trading convoy or harassing spanish and french merchant ships there s plenty of action but it s not all part of a single clear cut mission the kind of action we see will be familiar for readers of c s forester s horation hornblower series and other naval stories in that style one thing that bothers me about this kind of action is that you have to show your hero overcoming adverse odds and that means defeating stronger ships and regularly surprising the enemy but to do that your enemy needs to be less competent i have seen that in horation hornblower and also here all the tricks are from our hero and the enemy always falls for them because it s how these things go not that the hero always wins because sometimes the odds will be too overwhelming but the opponents definitely are dumber these exploits are inspired by thomas cochrane who achieved some victories of this kind in real life so it s not completely unbelievable but when you read many books like this it gets old if you can get past the vocabulary it is a well written story i enjoyed the time we spend on land or the daily life at sea with these characters as much or more than the action i particularly appreciated the way the point of view of both main characters complemented,1,0.91,0.09,0.91,0.08999999999999997

stepdaughter has potentially stolen property and her gma is backing her up sd turned yesterday and was wearing a gold diamond ring that was clearly an antique as the ct gold setting is rudimental the only person she could ve received this from was her gma i asked where the rings from convo went like this sd i found it me where sd in my jewellery box me who gave it to you sd i don t know i ve had it for ages me how long is ages sd i don t know then she went to her room and closed her bedroom door she avoided me all day til we went out i left it at that we went for a family meal last night and her brother asked her where the rings from she said dunno he gma said jack gave it to her this is her yr old boyfriend i asked if his mum gave permission as it s gold and looks to be a diamond her gma excused it that it s up to jack he gave it to her for her birthday and it s probably not even a diamond so i said well that doesn t matter it looks like it could be his grandmas ring and is sentimental to jack s family i can t see his mum letting him just give something like that away to a friend without talking to us as this point sd took the ring off and said she s sick of us all talking about it her brother said you ve took it off coz you ve got something to hide now gma will always back sd up no matter what she has stolen money for sweets in the past and her gma will excuse it saying we should ve give her enough to begin with sd has blatantly lied to my face about several things and when i ve said that is not what you told me she conveniently forgets what she told me so i ll tell her what she said and the reply is always well i didn t mean it like that she has bullied all her friends away so she only has jack left and she has manipulated him in the past to lie to get her out of trouble jack is very much a people pleaser i assume he s stolen the ring from his mum as a birthday gift to sd my partner never wants to get involved i ve told him that how her lies to me always go without even a light consequence is breeding undesirable traits in her i ve told him i ll speak to jacks mum to make sure that sd was gifted the ring if that s the case she can keep it but if not there needs to be a solid consequence and this lying to you about me to my face has to now be addressed otherwise i am backing right off from her and raising her as everyone s happy for me to take her out and treat her but the harsh side of parenting that they all fail her on they all don t want to know and gma always makes me out to be the bad guy i will pull away from everything involving sd including bonding with her please reddit help me with this i need a way of dealing with this that they can see is from a place of concern and not me being the evil stepmom that gma and sd make me out to be i want the best for sd but it looks like she s going down and wrong path that gma is happy to lead her down so as not to upset sd her dad has already told sd to stop involving gma when she s in trouble but she still does as gma can be formidable and sd always gets away with things to keep the peace i m yet to see sd ever get a consequence so she definitely never gets a punishment but i think this time something has to be done before she s further down a murky path thank you guys for anything you can suggest i feel physically sick as i know how gma will react,0,0.1,0.9,0.1,0.1

the persian boy by mary renault i just finished this up and wanted to recommend it to any fans of historical fiction here the story follows bagoas a eunuch gifted as a servant to alexander the great not long after his great victory over darius of persia bagoas is a real historical person who gets only occasional mention in the records of alexander s life the book is a wonder the prose is accessible while also being lyrical and even poetic at times the scope is astounding allowing the reader to see alexander s campaigns firsthand and bagoas is a sensitive thoughtful and sympathetic figure amidst the cruelty and splendor of the ancient world the portrait of alexander himself is the real treat here though in my opinion the book shows us a nuanced yet extraordinary character who is heroic flawed loving and a visionary leader this is one of those stories in which knowing how it ends takes nothing away from the journey,1,0.92,0.08,0.92,0.07999999999999996

feelings vs whining where is the line so i m sure every parent here has had their kid whining about something real or imagined many many times i ve always read and agree that its important to validate your kids feelings i can see that that is really frustrating you is a good opener to many situations that i always see but my question to all of you is where do you draw the line when does it just become whining and affecting the overall mood of the house my son is a notoriously cranky boy he will get super bent out of shape about legos being stuck together literally yelling at his toys yelling at the minecraft villagers for walking he wants them to stay put yelling at a booger stuck on his finger you get the idea we always respond with i understand that is frustrating but i can help you with that if you d like to try being quieter about it it rarely works while things have cooled down dramatically since he was which was screaming all day every day for any number of small problems its still something we deal with a lot and i m just wondering when to put it frankly people are to transition from feelings being validated to managing their anger i have all kinds of feelings for example but because i am the adult i am not allowed to be angry i can be frustrated but i can t show it it seems most other feelings are considered okay to let loose but anger frustration is one that we as humans try to curtail as much as we can after all no one likes a hot head right and showing that calm to your child is supposedly the best way to lead by example and show that you don t need to yell at everything just because you feel that way so its almost like a paradox to me the child can feel angry but if left to be that way forever he ll not know proper anger management and will be a hothead conversely if i be more firm with telling him to stop whining am i invalidating his feelings tl dr my son is pretty cranky boy he yells a lot whines a lot etc as many kids do we try to validate his feelings as much as we can but honestly i feel like we aren t doing enough because he whines a lot and wonder if we are too lax with it will he ever learn anger management on his own i type this as he yells at the second literally skippable commercial in front of one of his youtube videos every time,0,0.05,0.95,0.05,0.05

on the topic of stranger danger and other iterations of unknown equals bad don t talk to strangers etc this is not a new idea but i haven t seen it on this sub lately and imo it always bears repeating the concept of stranger danger as general advice is both antiquated and harmful especially for children it creates the idea that most people are bad or intend harm to others which i do not believe to be true it lays a foundation of mistrust suspicion and fear it s difficult to unravel or alter once it s set and creates an easy path for anxiety paranoia and hatred to enter the real harm almost always comes from faces we already know they are not strangers they are uncles and politicians and priests and neighbors we talk to our children about tricky people tricky people can be any size shape color or age tricky people can be friendly handsome and kind tricky people can wear uniforms tricky people are unlikely to act tricky all the time we might see a tricky person a hundred times before they attempt shenanigans luckily there are ways to spot them a tricky person might ask a child for help instead of another adult a tricky person might try to get you alone a tricky person may try to convince you it s okay to break the rules a tricky person may tell you to keep secrets our family has surprises instead which are secrets meant to be shared later if an adult or older child or anyone really is behaving in a way that causes discomfort or unease then you might have yourself a tricky person folks get out of there quickly and go tell your safe adult all about it in cases of emergency or separation we advise our children to stay where there are if it s safe to do so and look for a family look for children that are with their mommy and daddy ask that those parent s for help teach your children the correct names for their own bodily anatomy it s hilarious to hear a year old shout mom come wipe my anus teach them your name and phone number as soon they are old enough love them and let them love too strangers are almost never dangerous watch out for the tricky people,0,0.08,0.92,0.08,0.08
the meaning behind metamorphosis when i first read kafka s metamorphosis i thought g samsa was a victim of his ungrateful family however i now think that he was not so innocent g samsa actually crippled his family by carrying all the weight of the family on his back which meant his parents and sister would no longer make any effort to make something out of themselves because he was spoiling them somehow he wanted to be a victim and he got it i read it a while ago and this idea just popped into my head minutes ago did someone else get to this conclusion,1,0.36,0.64,0.36,0.64

boyfriends yo son seems to be trying to manipulate us via massive meltdowns hi reddit i m going to try to be diplomatic here because this is a child who is a product of his environment but we did just have massive blow out so if i come off as aggressive i apologize so my boyfriend late s has an yo almost son brent and he cannot stand to be alone or that s how it seems he needs constant attention and he talks endlessly he also has a lot of odd hang ups like with food he only eats very particular things and will often sift through whatever he s given before trying it but some examples to help explain today s issue once my boyfriend i walked with brent a building over it s very close so you can see from our apartment to do laundry we finished loading up the machines and gathering up our stuff to head back to our place and he ran ahead of us in the grass and we went back through the parking lot since we weren t directly behind him because he was supposed to follow us he ran back to the laundry room shrieked and had a meltdown i saw him sobbing and trudging back towards the apartment and comforted him while reminding him that he was supposed to be following us one time i walked out to get the mail and ran into my boyfriends mother who was a bit early to pick up brent for the day i hopped in her car to chat for a bit and while it did take a while i was right there my boyfriends son suddenly comes outside and walks up to the car again sobbing and i do l the whole hugs and comfort thing then today brent was upstairs playing with the neighbors so boyfriend and i decided to rent and watch a scary movie brent wound up coming back inside earlier than anticipated brent doesn t like scary movies but we often let him watch whatever he wants so i told him your dad and i really want to finish this movie so maybe you can play or read or draw in your room for the last minutes of this movie and he refused telling us we should watch something else that we all like i reminded him we often let him watch stuff that only he likes and that we deserve the same he decided to stay out with us the movie wasn t explicit just spooky so i told him that s fine but he absolutely cannot complain later about being scared because he made the choice to stay and in about minutes the movie got the scary music playing and he started to shake and cry and i paused the movie so he could go play in his room like i suggested to him in the beginning this time telling him and he had a meltdown saying that his room was terrifying and he doesn t want to go in there he s shaking and sobbing and expressing how scared he was this has never been an issue before being scared of his room so we brushed it off and told him that he needs to take minutes to have time out in his room because he s gotta calm down brent resisted and refused until his father lost his temper and yelled quite a bit which caused more sobbing until i intervened and told dad to take a smoke break and i ll take over time out now earlier today brent s dad and i were doing laundry and before we walked out the door brent spoke up referencing the time that he had a meltdown previous and said now guys don t forget to walk back on the grass because i don t like you in the parking lot where it s dangerous and then i reminded him that was not at all why that event happened he will often try to make up stories or change details to his benefit the parking lot is not very busy and it s small and he s never expressed having an issue with it i told him no you got scared because you lost track of us because you didn t follow us like we told you to do and i comforted you because you were scared and i totally understand how being scared feels but you caused yourself to feel that way that happened because you decided not to listen sooooo basically brent zeroed in on the part where i told him i comforted him because he was scared during his laundry room meltdown and kept expressing how scared he was during his scary movie meltdown in order to get out of having to just go play by himself for minutes while we finished our movie like really laying it on thick this is tiresome he can be a really sweet kid but he lies constantly and says whatever he s gotta say to get his way he ignores us often and breaks rules frequently he also has a habit of trying to hug whoever is trying to discipline him or chat with whoever walks by if he s in time out and the meltdowns are absolutely awful additionally they seem peculiar at his age he does have adhd but i m not sure if anything else i guess i m just looking for support and some advice on how to deal with this i feel like this kid controls all of our lives while we have him which is half the time but i m not at all sure how to deal with the massive meltdowns any advice or personal anecdotes would be helpful thanks,0,0.21,0.79,0.21,0.21

tana french in the woods why is the ending so disliked i have just finished reading in the woods by tana french about an hour ago i have to start by pointing out that i did not like the book for the first pages or so and i actually wanted to stop reading because it seemed to be all long winded descriptions of rural ireland and no action but then once all characters were properly introduced and started interacting something clicked and i was hooked yet i cannot for the life of me figure out why the ending is so universally disliked the main murder mystery that the actual plot introduces is solved in a satisfactory fashion we get to know the how we get to know the why rosaling escapes punishment which is in a way infuriating but perfectly shows how even in reality the guilty escape punishment by some oversight or miscarriage of justice and psychopaths are among us i found this outcome way more realistic and relatable than the entire investigation being neatly wrapped up and everyone getting their just punishment ryan totally falls apart and falls out with cassie and imo their reasons are perfectly believable cassie never lies yet she is accused of lying treated like shit and she probably realizes that ryan lies a lot given her past with a clinical psychopath it was probably the last straw for her i understand that some people wanted a happy end for them but i loved how absolutely depressive and bleak the entire ending was sure the s disappearances are never explained but i would have felt it extremely artificial if they were suddenly solved after years the ending leaves a lot of food for thought and leaves many interpretations open like for example whether ryan actually killed his friends in a daze similar to the one in which devlin and his friends raped sandra or because he thought similar to damien and devlin that by doing so he is somehow making things right or making the group stick together or whether there actually was something supernatural in the wood with all the wings flapping sniffing noises and weird vocalizations i love ambiguous endings like that is there anyone else who thinks the hate for the ending is totally unjustified,1,0.92,0.08,0.92,0.07999999999999996

has anyone read gould s book of fish possible spoilers in discussion just finished reading this book and wow what a ride i haven t seen much discussion about this book online and i feel like it s the kind of book you want to discuss it s kind of a story within a story from the perspectives of unreliable narrators who are forgers and criminals and artists it s a book about fish art truth and history love and hope imprisonment in the literal and figurative sense and the horrors of colonialism and the penal system it was really dark at times in regards to the treatment of the indigenous people and tortures of the prisoners but gives occasional respite in the form of humor and satire there is also magical realism that leaves you wondering what is true the writing was great yet mostly accessible and i couldn t stop reading towards the end because i felt like anything could happen i m still processing the ending i think it was mostly predictable but very satisfying although i kind of wish it went all out in terms of magical realism especially in regards to brady who remained an elusive mystery til the end,1,0.97,0.03,0.97,0.030000000000000027

beartown by fredrik backman broke me there is so much that i want to talk about when it comes to this book but i feel so overwhelmed by everything i am feeling i usually do an in depth analysis of each character and the book s themes but this book gave me so much to think about that i need a minute to just take it all in i started the sequel but i think i need a minute before i can continue still i would love to hear everyone s thoughts about the book and their own analysis i am not sure why this book specifically had this strong effect on me but this book is different book is so gut wrenchingly beautiful and sad its just so realistic and it broke my heart it explores the many layers that make up people the complexities of morality the power of words or the lack of them how silence itself can be betrayal it how difficult and complicated real people are each person has his own life that continues on as a side story even when tragedy happens life is never black or white but many shades of grey there is so much i want to discuss in depth this is a book about being a parent and about raising boys about the boys will be boys culture but also this is a book that tells a story about being a woman by telling us about a boy s hockey team i have included my review that i wrote for goodreads down below spoilers below the book starts by getting you emotionally invested into their world of hockey you understand their passion their love for the game these men and boys are not brainless jocks who just enjoy violence their love for the game runs so much deeper the characters are not paper thin each person has his own reason for being part of this world everyone has a story the book makes you understand them makes you think you understand this town a quote by margaret atwood says knowing too much about other people puts you in their power they have a claim on you you are forced to understand their reasons for doing things and then you are weakened this is exactly what the book does in the first half it puts us in the character s power it drags you into their adrenaline filled world its exciting it magnetic its charming slightly toxic but no harm done boys are just being boys its just jokes then suddenly its disgusting its horrifying its terrible it leaves a bad taste in your mouth boys are not just boys they are monsters jokes are not just jokes culture is as much about what we encourage as what we permit most people don t do what we tell them to they do what we let them get away with i desperately wanted to love these boys i wanted them to succeed to win as a team i got dragged into their world and into beartown unconsciously i too pinned my hopes and dreams for that little town on the boys then i felt angry at myself for allowing myself to fall for it to become charmed by this sport but i think this is exactly what the author wanted the book does a fantastic job of making us understand the complexity of knowing someone who has done something terrible especially when so much depends on them starting the book i knew that a rape happens but i did not know who the people involved were when i read the rape scene one of my first thoughts was no please don t let it be him because i desperately wanted him to be better than that then i felt so ashamed of myself because this poor girl just got raped the betrayal i felt when i read the rape scene is a fraction of what the people of beartown have felt i only got to know these characters for a second they ve lived with each other a lifetime as disgusting as it is the book forces you for a second to understand where they are coming from even if they are awful cruel people now everything that was beautiful about these boys their loyalty to each other their camaraderie it becomes terrible and horrifying it makes me want to throw up the best things people do for each other occur precisely because of loyalty the only problem is that many of the very worst things we do to each other occur because of the same thing for the rest of the book i felt disgusted i felt rage at the injustice done as a woman i felt betrayed i was in awe of maya s strength the book presents a very realistic depiction of what it means to be a girl the toxic misogynistic culture the patriarchy the powerlessness of being a girl in a world that celebrates men i wanted to scream i wanted to burn down the whole town for maya it broke my heart into a million pieces perhaps one day the man in the black jacket will think about this too why he only wondered if it was kevin or amat who was telling the truth why maya s word wasn t enough the book also shows a heart wrenching depiction of people s fear of exclusion this is also a story about the things people will do just to be part of something they distance people will go just to be accepted how much people are willing to betray others and themselves just so they can be told that they belong amat is amazed at how straightforward it is staying silent in return for being allowed to join in at the end of the book i feel very conflicted about many of the characters the book forces me to understand benjie and a part of me loves him but i cannot get over the feeling of betrayal because he never said anything about maya i feel a mix of love and hatred similarly i don t know how to feel about david i hate him with burning passion yet his relationship with benjie and his love for the boys as a father figure is beautiful its only a game it can only change people s lives,1,0.76,0.24,0.76,0.24

how much can i expect a nd child to join the family vs centering our life around baby i hope this makes sense our lives completely changed when our son was born obviously we gladly completely built our lives and daily activities around him he s now and we re considering having another they d be years apart could we expect a baby toddler preschooler to sort of fit into our family life and activities or would having a second mean completely changing everything to center around the youngest again like could we continue hiking vacations but the baby toddler would need to stay in a carrier so we could complete the hike or would that wind up being miserable and we would avoid those types of things what about like if attending a library activity for the oldest could the youngest be expected to attend quietly or would i have to leave my oldest and take the youngest out it makes me sad to think that having another would mean neglecting my first we really don t want to be splitting up one parent with each child we d like to do as much together as possible tl dr we completely gave everything in our life to do what was best for our son so i have no frame of reference for how far you can go in the other direction like how little can you change your family life with a second child,0,0.08,0.92,0.08,0.08

something i noticed about pet sematary king made thoroughly sure to describe victor pascow s sinister injuries in as much macabre detail as possible we also know that he was guess what struck by a car so it comes as a surprise to us that louis notes the fact that church after having been hit by a car or more likely an entire orinco truck was not nearly mangled and only had a broken neck but was otherwise intact similarly gage was not afaik and remember ever hinted at being horribly mangled but instead quite intact enough that when he returned from the dead he was more or less physically normal which is weird and made me wonder does the energy or power of the real pet sematary tend towards keeping the bodies of its future victims from being seriously destroyed so that it can successfully resurrect them after all i doubt louis would ve tried to bury gage in the cemetery if he had been turned into a gage p t under that truck even given louis s state of mind he would ve known that it wouldn t really be possible to resurrect toddler smoothie but gage s well preserved body was probably an easy way for the power to seep into louis s mind and persuade him to bury his son there,1,0.22,0.78,0.22,0.78

i ve been reading brandon sanderson s stormlight archives and i m thoroughly underwhelmed so i ve been trying to acquaint myself more with the fantasy genre as i m not super well read on it have read a few new ones that i really loved realm of the elderlings book of the new sun the first law discworld and some that i disliked wheel of time i ve also gone through a lot of the canon stuff like lotr and asoiaf loved them both brandon sanderson seems to be one of the most popular authors in the genre out there so his works seemed like the next logical step i was advised to start with stormlight as it was made out to be his magnum opus of sorts cool books big chunky tomes good stuff it started off well enough the world he created is rather interesting and quite immersive characters seemed promising too but after the first book ended it kinda just felt like a prologue what s more the prose and dialogue were honestly kinda terrible characters weren t much to write home about either i was coming off of robin hobb and joe abercrombie so these aspects seemed especially galling but ok the worldbuilding was still pretty cool and that carried me through a lot of it i figure ok maybe the second book will be better across all fronts but nah pretty much the same issue there too the writing is just so dull and wooden and the characters so boring and archetypical all their interactions seem so monotonous and like it s only there to move the plot along and some of the dialogue especially where it seems like the author is attempting to be witty is mind bogglingly cringeworthy as for the plot it s alright i guess even though it seems like a very typical good vs evil story i m also starting to notice that these books are very mechanical formulaic nothing much happens for the majority of the story and then there s some over the top cheesy final fantasy dragonball z type climax in the last hundred pages or so i forced myself through the third book and there was some promise there with the exploration on mental illness and such but again it just devolves into a cartoon by the end also idk if it s just me but the action and story development feels very video game esque it almost reminds me of playing action rpgs with characters gaining attributes and leveling up and getting buffs and debuffs or whatever and throughout all books i did not see a single hint of any improvement in the prose or ability to write meaningful interesting dialogue or interactions between characters especially between men and women also it seems like the story is geared towards a younger audience for a story about an epic war it seems very weirdly sanitized and clean cut idk maybe it s just not for me but the series seems to be super highly rated among fans of the genre so i was expecting more i guess it s not all bad though as i did really enjoy the world sanderson created and the magic power system was pretty interesting it s just that the writing characters and actual narrative within that world felt really poorly developed,1,0.94,0.06,0.94,0.06000000000000005

just finished mother night by vonnegut and it may be my favorite book of his so far the writing story characters and all of it were great using campbell as a way to explore the human individual and human groups was genius i ve also been reading albert camus s committed writings which includes a couple of his essays letters to a german friend and reflections of the guillotine the parallels between these two essays and mother night are super interesting and only add to it all they both have themes of anti nationalism the good and corruption of people as an individual and a society country and the overall state of the world the craziest part of it is seeing how relevant these essays and books are to our world today i know a common thing to do with mother night is discuss whether you think campbell was guilty or not i don t think he was while he may have had some personal guilt i think the powers that be us government in this case were largely responsible for the people that were victims of his propaganda and for putting campbell through what he did while he was seemingly indifferent towards either side of the war he was a spy for the us and working towards their goals as he says he didn t do it out of patriotism or anything of the sort more so out of just being pushed along in life he talks about how he made his propaganda so ridiculous and crazy intentionally hoping that the people he was targeting would never believe it as indifferent as he comes across it does seem that he did find himself somewhat guilty at least in a personal sense he talks of having to teach and convince himself not to feel guilt and then the book ends well how it ends after realizing the converting effect he had on people even years later and coming to grips with it it would be hard not to have any personal guilt i think a better question is should he personally feel guilty and or remorseful about what he did this will definitely be one to reread,1,0.86,0.14,0.86,0.14

the wind up bird chronicle and absurdity so i recently just finishing reading the wind up bird chronicle by haruki murakami and i still am not sure if i enjoyed it it is such a masterfully written book and i think a lot of it probably went over my head but i found some passages of the book harder to get through than others specifically the flashback scenes taking place during world war ii i did love the subtle approach murakami takes with his absurdist elements as they slowly start to invade the narrative with meandering surreal moments that toru encounters i was wondering if anyone else has struggled with this book in deciding whether or not they like it and whether or not i should read another murakami as this was the first one i have read by him,1,0.98,0.02,0.98,0.020000000000000018

opinion there is no right way to describe women in literature i just finished reading killing commendatore by haruki murakami so i did what i always do after reading a book search reddit for some good discussions about said book for killing commendatore almost every post was about how terrible the way murakami described women was there was a disturbing part where the main character was describing his dead little sister and mentioned the way he noticed her breasts growing almost everyone seems to find this part poor or uncomfortable murakami has a reputation for poorly portraying women in his books in general where he has this weird habit of focusing on their breasts i personally read literature to get the perspective of other people namely people how i think are brilliant i like to see how they feel about stuff how they think and how they put all these things together i don t care one bit about the rightness of their feelings or whether they align with my own all i want to get from my reading experience is perspective so when an author describes women poorly subjectively speaking that is a part of the perspective of that author naturally you can argue that this perspective sucks and you don t like it which is completely fair but i think you shouldn t read literature looking for things that align with what you d like the most brilliant books are the ones that offer a very different idea about the world than the one we had if everyone wanted to read only books that offer mainstream perspective no one would have liked lolita unless you suck as a human being of course i am not saying you should like the way murakami describes women i am just saying if you choose to move past that part you d be rewarded well not always because some of his books are actually disappointing looking at you colorless tsukuru tazaki because murakami is an extremely unique writer and his perspective is golden,1,0.98,0.02,0.98,0.020000000000000018

spoiler i don t get the hype for stephen kings salems lot so i have a few complaints about this book i do recognize that it is his second published book hence why his writing style has not matured yet but i can t understand the hype around this book i watched youtube video reviews and read posts on this book and nobody has anything bad to say about it i found much of the book to be either redundant or anti climactic redundant because of the fact that he essentially goes into minute detail of practically every resident in jarusalems lot this in itself takes up a good portion of the book in which he could have taken the time to flesh out what the vampires are and what their motivations were personally i wish he took a more obscure way of presenting the vampires rather then them just being the stereotypical run of the mill ghoulies i think the book could have been condensed to a short novel or even a novella in terms of the anti climatic portion i found what was supposed to be the best part of the book to be bland and predictable there was no real twists or depth to anything that happened also what in hell is the point of father callahan my friend told me about father callahan and hyped me up for what i thought was going to be a van helsing esque type character instead he goes in gets defeated and leaves,1,0.77,0.23,0.77,0.22999999999999998

how old is old enough to expect a kid to keep their promises hi fellow parents gotten lots of good advice in the past so would like to recanvas the well and see if my expectations are legit or out of whack my almost yo has had this really crummy pattern of behaviour these past few weeks right around the time she needs to shower she ll ask to watch youtube videos she has a playlist of videos she cycles through first i ll confirm with her that we will shower after the videos and she agrees emphatically after the videos though omg getting her to shower is a nightmare she will start demanding more videos then yelling no no no when i tell her we need to shower and just insist on another video another video another video i ve tried damn hard to be empathetic but i am so done i have always tried to remember my promises to her so i don t believe i am not modelling for her what it means to keep promises i cannot figure out why she hates showers and she has no issue with them in the mornings either and while i do acknowledge she might be tired she doesn t show any other signs of fatigue so what age is it reasonable for me to expect her to keep her promises am i being unfair am i stunting her development somehow i try and respect her views and give her space to vent but this is bordering on ridiculousness for me tl dr am i being unfair to my almost year old when she doesn t keep to her side of the bargain promise,0,0.07,0.93,0.07,0.07

reading poetry difficulty or relatability i m rediscovering poetry again and i m finding that i m leaning more towards poems that are relatively easy to digest and that are relatable to me and my experiences whenever i read poems i always go back to what my literature teachers always say that poetry should speak of universal truths of things that can be understood by all types of people from all backgrounds sometimes difficult poetry make me feel like an outsider because i can t pick up subtle references to old masters and literary images but i also understand that that can be the fun in reading works like that the investigative part but personally i like the simple yet profound stuff anyways i m curious about everyone else s take on reading and choosing poetry what makes something hard for you to read what makes a poem stick to you do you like digging up the gems inbetween verses or do you prefer digesting things as you read them i d love to see everyone s thoughts on this my favorite poets at the moment are louise gl ck mary oliver and everyone s favorite papa neruda,1,0.68,0.32,0.68,0.31999999999999995
i really enjoyed emma by jane austen but i might dnf pride and prejudice would love some advice i d like advice on whether i should continue based on my experience so far i enjoyed emma a lot the writing was great and i love the imperfect characters and the troubles they spawn via their actions i e emma s meddling on to pride and prejudice i am now at the point where having heard that her sister jane has caught a cold elizabeth has gone to see jane at mr bingly s house so i m not that far in and i m feeling pretty neutral about the story i have a long tbr list so i tend to drop stories that don t grab my attention i think my problem is that pride and prejudice seems to have a faster pace than emma pride and prejudice has short and snappy chapters with a lot of characters needing to be introduced and summarised quickly without much dwelling on what is happening whereas emma seemed to dwell more on the conversations and characterisations of a smaller cast for example i was a little thrown by being told in quite short order that mr darcy didn t think much of lizzie then seemed to change his mind quite quickly my question is this does pride and prejudice maintain this faster pace throughout or does it slow down a bit and dwell more on characters and their conversations and thoughts if it does the latter i ll persist with it,1,0.66,0.34,0.66,0.33999999999999997

don t know what to do with my sister anymore my mom is a single mother and due to our big age gap i m and my sister is and our family dynamic i am functionally a second parent to my sister i have just as much of a hand in raising her as my mom does which my mom agrees with my mom and i both have different ideas on how my sister should be raised for example i don t believe in spanking or hitting but she seems to think it s the only way my sister s behavior will change over the past two years my sister has become apathetic disrespectful and downright mean she regular says things like i m the most beautiful person in the world and i m not going to grow up and do anything because there s no point and i don t care or i don t know why you re talking to me because i m not listening i ve lost count of how many times she s told me that she hates me or that i m lazy when we try to talk to her and tell her that she s wrong when she says these things she says oh so you think i m a terrible lazy mean worthless person well i ll just go live with my dad then since you hate me this usually sets my mom off and sends her into a rage which can end badly sometimes with her spanking my sister with a belt i ve tried asking my mom to use alternative modes of punishment like grounding and etc which she does but then the behavior continues and my mom uses that as proof that she needs to spank her more often arguments between them can get pretty nasty with some cruel words flying and my sister isn t afraid to cut a low blow with me either although when she says something hurtful to me i just take a breath walk away and come back later to administer punishment which is usually taking away electronics or extra chores my mom was rough with me and i know how it feels so i am gentle with her and careful with my words because i know that although she talks a big game she s sensitive to my words my mom gives me just as much responsibility to my sister as a parent but at the end of the day she is legally my mom s child and i can t stop her from spanking her i feel torn between them because my sister s lackadaisical and disrespectful behavior is uncalled for and should be punished but i hate seeing her crying on the floor underneath my mom when she spanks her any advice,0,0.05,0.95,0.05,0.05

where is home my wife and i are new parents coming up on two years like any new parents priorities change we are at a point where we are trying to find a place to settle and raise our family there are many factors but ultimately it boils down to three scenarios continue to live in boston with great careers high cost of living and no family nearby move back to colorado to be closer to family and friends and lose half of our income move someplace new that is more affordable we want to be close to family and like every parents dream is to create a better childhood for our kids than what we grew up with i fear that we won t be able create a better childhood for our kids in colorado because of costs and lack of adequate jobs family is important but is it worth being close to family and giving our children those memories to a point where it sets our family back financially idk if i am looking for an answer but was wondering if anyone else has had to make a decision on settling when careers and family are on the line how did you decide are you happy with your decision,0,0.18,0.82,0.18,0.18
was i wrong for telling my sister to stay away from my month old my sister and her family have been staying with us for over a month already because their house got damaged in the texas freeze earlier this year this morning i confronted my sister who s pregnant if she s been wearing her mask when she goes out in public and she said no we proceeded to have a discussion on why and she said i m done living my life in fear i already got vaccinated i don t need to wear a mask i then told her that she s dumb for not wearing a mask because the vaccine does not guarantee immunity and she could give it to my gf myself and my month old i told her to not touch or carry my kid anymore because she refuses to wear a mask she s been kissing him and hugging him the whole time she s been staying with us she said it s within my right to want that but i could tell she got upset because i called her dumb aita i later apologized for calling her dumb but still stayed firm on how i felt for putting my family at risk while staying with me aita,0,0.07,0.93,0.07,0.07

a little help with baudelaire s le fleurs du mal is james mcgown a good translator i have been reading the english translation by james mcgowan and i have some questions about the way he translates the french i can give you an example here which i think really alters the meaning of the poem now i am not perfectly fluent in french and i have looked at google translate to check my translation but here goes in the cat the french goes like this dans ma cervelle se promene ainsi qu en son appartement un beau chat fort doux et charmant quand il miaule on l entend a peine mcgowan seems to translate it in a very prosaic way which leaves out in my opinion a distinction that i think baudelaire is making in the first stanza and one that gives more meaning to the purpose of the cat as a literary device in this poem mcgowan translate it as a cat is strolling through my mind acting as though he owned the place a lovely cat strong charming sweet when he meows one scarcely hears but my reading of the french is more like in my brain is walking as well as in his apartment a beautiful cat strong gentle and charming when he meows you can hardly hear him i get the feeling though my french may be poor that baudelaire is saying that the cat is not acting like the apartment is his own but has established that the cat is the owner of the apartment in the way we know cats to behave when we own them or have them in the house which would make the poet narrator a kind of witness to this strange projection of a mental moment in a strange space that he is also quite familiar with the way it s translated you miss that the cat is both spectral and also a real cat and that there is this connection between the physical cat performing its cat duties in the real world and the illusory and mental image cat that is also owner of the mental space or the cerebral garret of the poet s mind i think this is really distinct in the french but i wondered if someone with better skill than me could tell me if i am reading too much into the original french on the whole is this considered a good translation of baudelaire i feel like there is something a bit off with this book and that there must be better translations of flowers of evil somewhere,1,0.82,0.18,0.82,0.18000000000000005
reading pride and prejudice for the first time sort of confused let me preface this by saying that i am not a native english speaker that might be the issue here or i m just not used to this era of literature and or have a bad memory anyway i ve been going through the classics one by one since i consider it important to have a basic understanding of literature i picked up pride and prejudice recently and expected that i would hate it sounded like a sappy romance novel to me i must say that i m pleasantly surprised so far however i am having some major trouble following the plot and remembering the character s names and who they are i m about pages in and still get confused each time miss bennet bingley or mrs hurst are mentioned and i can barely remember the bennet sister s names for example i keep mixing up lydia and lizzy elizabeth the places also confuse me also i often can t understand what is sarcastic and what is not so i end up reading the same passage several times to understand it my question is does it get any easier i am definitely enjoying the book but it s very tough to read which surprises me since i have read other books from this era which have been easier to understand something about the mix of serious social commentary sarcasm and actual plot is confusing me and i feel like lots of things are going right over my head,1,0.97,0.03,0.97,0.030000000000000027

medical emergencies that never were yesterday my wife started having some early contractions and i worked myself into a bit of a panic and we went to the emergency room now just to set the scene a little bit before i go on we live in thailand and in many hospitals it s common to get an ultrasound every month it doesn t cost extra so why not we always go to the appointments together my wife myself and our toddler i m usually really diligent about asking questions from the doctor and understanding everything some might even say annoyingly so but this last appointment i guess i got a little comfortable and didn t pay much attention as i was talking to our toddler about her coming baby sister so my wife is weeks pregnant with our second child our first came at weeks a picture of health ever since she s been born hallelujah so were expecting that this baby could be coming soon too yesterday after a little afternoon delight she started getting some mild contractions this made me want to check the last ultrasound and check how close the baby might be to a birth weight size it was only then that i noticed that her measurements were normal at our last visit for all measurements except one that one wasn t just off a little bit either it was measured to be less than the th percentile for week olds mind you my wife is weeks at this point my first thought is that it must be an error by the machine certainly the doctor would notice such a discrepancy so i checked if other ultrasounds showed healthy measurements but it turned out that was the only ultrasound that the doctor included that measurement on the printout what s especially crazy is that the ratios of the measurements are all in the appropriate percent ranges so i thought how can one measurement be so low yet the ratio remain consistent with a healthy baby regardless is makes me think perhaps it s possible the doctor saw the ratios were healthy and missed the actual measurement okay so now i ve got no past data to compare to and in my mind a reasonable explanation as to why this could have been missed by the doctor no matter though because i m not crazy and i m not going to panic i thought i m just going to see if there s a good explanation on the google machine long story short google told me that there is no good explanation for this phenomenon except severe disability the scary one that comes from zika virus we went to the nicest hospital in town to ensure we had the best machine that would be least likely to have a mistake to check the accuracy of our other ultrasound everything was fine all measurements and ratios healthy just an error of unknown origin anybody have similar stories of a panic over a problem with your child which turns out to be nothing,0,0.11,0.89,0.11,0.11

can i just say i am friggin tired of characters being killed and then brought back to life seriously it s just bad writing in film tv or books i just finished a book where no less than characters were killed the main character was stabbed through the heart in a deathmatch and brought back to life through magic the secondary character was shot through the heart and will be brought back through love and a side character was assumed dead by fire until the last page even the main bad guy has been imprisoned and is expected to escape and seek revenge and now i think about it the secondary bad guy was shot through the head but is a magical being who has died many times before in the tv show gotham they end one season with a main character being shot in the chest and sinking into a lake yet in the next he s brought back to life after that they make inside jokes about how being dead doesn t seem to mean much around here and movies abound with the oh he she died hey you made it just stop it write a story that requires suspension of disbelief but doesn t treat us as morons won t name the book it was a fair read even with all the dead not dead,1,0.96,0.04,0.96,0.040000000000000036

communication with and about the other parent is exhausting i don t even know where to start my daughter is years old and we never lived with her father the relationship ended shortly after she was born since then they had very limited contact to each other because he rarely ever asked to meet her we never had a rule of when he can spend time with her up until recently but he could visit her whenever he wanted he usually just didn t show up without even saying anything until i texted him i always found it extremely disrespectful because we could have made other plans if we had known also it was very hard on my daughter a few months ago i agreed to let her visit him every second weekend i always said she could do so when she was six and not early er due to reasonable savety concerns since then it got much harder before we just rarely talked he would visit i would give them space he would leave again i would occasionally send pictures or inform him of milestones of upcoming events he once even attended one but now it is more difficult after she came back from her first weekend i picked her up at the station it was extremely cold she had gotten a cold while with him she was wearing no socks no underwear no mask she smelled horrible she later confirmed that she had not brushed her teeth or washed her butt all weekend and even told me she was left alone with her half siblings the youngest one being two years old the oldest when i texted him that i would expect him to not leave her alone especially with such a young child and that he has to make sure she is dressed appropriately and that he has to make sure she at least brushes her teeth he got very mad send voicemessages of shouting at me and claimed i was a bad mother for not driving her to where he lives she also ate nothing but candy cake and ice cream and watched tv literally all day long this i didn t even criticize to him because i think he gets to make decisions about food and screentime just as i do when she is with me and it is not my job to judge on that the lifestyle will not harm her when it s just every other weekend that was the start of the downfall of our respectful relationship since then he has made a habit out of refusing to communicate when he will arrive at the station so that i can t make any plans the day i bring her to the station and the day i pick her up to spite me keep in mind i am doing him a favor by driving her to the station in the first place and saving him another hour in the bus it is extremely frustrating when i ask him to change his behavior i get very mean spirited responses whenever we meet he is friendly but the texts are often horrible i try to improve the relationship by sharing pictures with him to show him that his daughter is taken care of a short time ago my daughter wanted to cut her hair short so i did it for her next time i send pictures of my daughter visiting a museum he saw it and he threw a fit about it he said girls needed to have long hair and be pretty he claimed i had cut it because i was to lazy to take care of her hair i enjoyed doing her hair and that i was a bad influence on her because i have short hair at this point i am just exhausted all i wanted to do was share some nice pictures and this happens i do everything on my own finances included and while i might not be perfect my daughter is well developed in every way imaginable and a very happy and emotionally stable child instead of appreciating what i do he throws unreasonable criticisms at me i also struggle with communicating with my daughter about the whole issue i don t tell her when we fight but i can t hide him cancelling visits and not showing up to school events i am torn on how to talk to her when she is sad because on one side i don t want to speak poorly about her dad to her on the other side i don t want her self esteem to suffer because she sees her own parent rejecting her over and over again in my profession i have been taught that generally it is important to call people out infront of the person who was wronged by them but obviously the consensus about parenting in specific is not to speak poorly of the other parent i usually say i don t know why he can t make it i am sure you are very important to him but we don t know what is going on in his life right now but when he didn t show up on special occasions i started criticising it by saying i think this is a very important day and i think your father should have made it possible to be here only when she starts the topic of her father not being there am i wrong for doing so,0,0.12,0.88,0.12,0.12

is it okay to feed my son play dough recently i haven t been able to afford dinner for me or son so i was wondering if it was okay for him to eat play dough as a meal we recently got a lot of play dough for his birthday so a lot of it is new so he wouldn t be eating any that was played with i know its okay for kids to eat play dough every once and a while but i m not sure if it s okay for a full meal also would it even make him full and if it is fine to feed him it how much would be safe for a year old i also want to add that i wouldn t have this as a permanent solution but more so just for a few days every month or two so he doesn t starve all night and will stop asking for food,0,0.09,0.91,0.09,0.09
mom recovering from surgery year old is out of control advice please tldr i am recovering from surgery and my year old is giving me a harder time than my toddler hey folks i am kind of expressing frustration and also asking for actionable advice i am a sahm of two daughters they are just shy of and three weeks ago i underwent a breast reduction and arm lift i have lost a ton of weight and was left with hugely unbalanced breasts that were causing me shoulder issues and it seemed like a good time to address the arms too which also had huge drapes of skin left for the first two most critical weeks i had either my husband home from work or a hired sitter here now i am days post op and since monday this week have returned to the regular life flow of being alone with the kids each weekday we have made it literally two days in and the wheels are already falling off i am able to do the few physical things that have to be done i can change the toddlers diaper extremely carefully she is even able to comprehend that mommy has big booboos and she is refraining from her usual thrashing and kicking routine which is just so sweet and heartwarming she understands i need her to help me out aside of that i can dole out activities and serve a meal but i need things calm and chill to prevent injuries to them and me and to have some peace to be able to rest and recovery when i can the arm lift is causing me some issues i have delayed healing i have burning nerve pain i am swollen with reduced mobility my year old is breaking my heart by just outright disobeying every directive i give her right now we have had a daily morning talk about needing to stick with calm and quiet activities during the day arts and crafts a movie playing dollhouse etc no running no screaming save it for the afternoon when dad is home and takes them out she agrees but then within literal minutes of her dad leaving she encourages her sister into running around screaming screeching throwing things i tell her to stop she literally sneers at me with any corrections it is bizarre she incites the baby into wild games that inevitably lead to the baby falling and getting hurt or getting offended and having a tantrum she does it over and over and over i send her to her room she comes back down of her own accord within minutes i send her back up she sneers at me from the stairs we repeat the talk about being calm she agrees she will then go interrupt the toddlers quiet activity of reading or coloring and encourage her to climb on her back and bark like a dog or whatever crap she comes up with next i feel my blood pressure rise every time she comes into the room now she is aware i am a lame duck and i feel like she is outright exploiting the situation and purposely doing the opposite of what she is asked she is going and helping herself fo stuff from the pantry and giving the toddler stuff like lollipops which i told her don t give her as the toddler will bite of pieces and i need to avoid the terror of her choking at this point i would have to tear my incisions to save her she does it anyhow and i then need to wrestle a lollipop from a toddler because of the year old taking it upon herself to give it against my wishes we have a small fenced back courtyard but i don t want the toddler out there during the day now it s fully paved she falls a lot i don t want to need to patch booboo knees that could ve been avoided i hear the door slide open she lets her out anyway i have to tell her to come back in cue the tears she is acting like she rules the home and makes the decisions and i am just a pesky fly buzzing around in her ear i have never put hands on this child nor would i so i don t know why this would even be something to exploit but i feel like she is exploiting the fact that i am physically suffering and pushing every limit literally we have only made it two days into doing home alone with them again and she is the only issue it blows my mind that the toddler has a better grasp of the situation and is acting with more compassion and consideration than an year old the toddler only causes issues when literally led into the situations by her sister otherwise she is so content to sit and read with me or color or do stickers or whatever else keeps her calm and quiet with me i am so at my wits end i feel hurt and betrayed and i don t understand why she is doing this i am corrected her constantly and i feel i would have an easier recovery with just the toddler alone she is able to sit and play quietly she doesn t do these kind of behaviors unless her sister is encouraging it i don t want to make my big one stay in her room all day but i feel like i am getting backed against a wall and if she will not follow the rules for the couple of weeks that i need to protect myself and the toddler and make her stay in her room alone what other choice do i have i am still so fresh out of surgery that a big blow to my incisions could set me back months and i can t let that happen because she is bored or whatever her reasoning is which i have asked but she will not tell me she just shrugs and says i will behave better now but doesn t we have no local family i cannot afford to employ a sitter daily because the year old is acting out i can manage their basic needs but she is making this time period a nightmare i am at a loss as to why she is doing this but i am deeply hurt and trying to remind myself she is just a kid but she is also a big kid and can see the literal wounds on my body she knows i had a hour surgery she promised to be a good helper and now this i know this is a mile long sorry i am so pent up with frustration any advice on getting through this time would be appreciated,0,0.06,0.94,0.06,0.06
books about puberty anatomy my daughters are both pretty interested in how my mom body is different from theirs they are only and but we talk about everything they want to know i m all about having many small appropriate conversations and not condensing it to one big talk i read somewhere how discussing puberty and how their bodies will change is a great way to begin that bridge to one day talking about sex and sexuality but i can t find the article it had recommendations of very simple books about puberty but i just can t remember them do you have any books for your young children that tackle the concept of puberty,0,0.56,0.44,0.56,0.56

should i read now because i know this possible spoiler hello friends so i ve heard alot about this book and want to read it there was once a reddit post about it and one stu d user posted in the comments how amazing it was to see that the guy cried at the end something along those lines a few months ago i opened the book to read it and it started off by introducing the a character as a cold hearted and an emotionless man it further went into detail how emotionless he was even as a child it was as if a light bulb went off in my head and i knew that he was gonna cry at the end i immediately lost my appetite for reading it and left it at that now i m wondering if i should just give up reading it i don t wanna go through pages for something that i already know despite there being other interesting story arcs in there p s feel free to recommend me a can t put down fiction if you know off any thanks,1,0.83,0.17,0.83,0.17000000000000004
help a new father need advice with a week old i ll keep it somewhat short my wife and i welcomed are new girl last july the first weeks i thought i had this parenting thing pretty down it was daily easy i ll be honest however week to now has been very challenging i m just seeking a little guidance my little girl has turned ravenous wanting to eat all the time at least every hour she always seems uncomfortable and impossible to get to sleep at her month appointment our np thought it was reflux gave us pepcid my wife and i are nervous about using it so early we did it the first day but decided to wait on meds she rarely spits up and doesn t seem to have the typical reflux symptoms my wife had a motherly instinct that she was hungry not feeling fulfilled from her breast we gave her a oz of formula and she fell right asleep for to hours it was the first time in days she seemed content my wife never thought of a shortage of breast milk since she always poops and pee s she s still team breast milk but the following night we decided to recreate that magical elixir of formula only to end with her puking the whole meal up so we re hesitant to continue any formula we called the lactation specialist nurse and she says these are growth weeks and to basically deal with it and to not use formula my wife also agrees she thinks she produces enough milk and she drains them most feedings it s been almost a week now and every waking moment she s sucking her mouth for food generally fussyness and crying took her up to hours to get her down most days this week i can accept this being a growth spurt but it s getting hard because it s been a week without holding my baby not in discomfort and screaming to get back on the breast as the father i m feeling useless because i obviously don t supply milk and im back to working full time my wife is alone most of the days and i see her struggling i think she s a rockstar but the lack of her seeing a happy baby seems to be crushing her morale i m just reaching out to see if anyone else had these rough weeks around of life google tells me its normal but maybe reading stories from a few real people will help us out,0,0.08,0.92,0.08,0.08
i feel stupid today i f facetimed my dad to check on him because he s in the hospital with covid i didn t have any specific look on my face to my knowledge but he read that something was wrong maybe i was just deep in thought because i have been really stressed lately so i told him that i m just trying to figure out what i want to do with myself because for the last years my kids father has been pretty much taking care of me and because we ve had our issues and still do i kind of want to have my own finances but i don t know where to start because i ve been being taken care of and i don t have anything to show for myself i explained this to my dad he s well enough to talk now so the first thing that he told me was that i have to get away from my kids dad bc of the fighting and arguing in the past i explained to him that that wasn t the case and that i just wanted to establish something for me and my children to fall back on in case things go south with their dad so after i said that a nurse walked in and he said that he was going to call me back and he never called back i feel so stupid something told me not to open up to him he hasn t been the best father growing up and now that we re older i don t think he s changed much i initially stopped talking to him because he d always tell my business to everyone i guess i can just hang this up with trying to build something with him i just wish i had a male to talk to sometimes to get insight from their view,0,0.23,0.77,0.23,0.23
is there a moratorium on negative book reviews by media outlets i am currently in a book club and we are finishing up a book i absolutely despise naturally i wanted to see if someone else may have articulated those particular aspects of the book that i didn t feel worked better than i could articulate them however i was only met with praising reviews from critics this has become a trend i have noticed there only ever appear to be positive book reviews or no review at all while this has likely boosted the sales of books in general for me i find that is very difficult to find more than a handful of current authors that i actually like there is a clear presumption here i know that some level of objective quality is in line with my taste i am not so sure that what i want is a good book because clearly this book i despise is good in a lot of ways but overall it doesn t work for me so instead of quality in the objective sense i am looking for quality in the subjective sense to do that i need to find reviewers whose subjective sense of quality is more closely aligned with my own with only positive reviews to go on that process is near impossible i want to be able to find reviewers even if they aren t of the majority opinion that have a taste similar to my own i need to be able to identify what they do and don t like so that i have some basis to expect whether i would like the book or not from their review it seems like i can t trust reviews for books made in the last five years so instead i find that i need to look to whether authors i do like have recommended the books or whether the book has won awards other than reviews which appear to favor every book in mass is there any other ways to isolate the types of books you all like,1,0.97,0.03,0.97,0.030000000000000027
if i didn t like the road should i read other cormac mccarthy i enjoy stories where more events take place and there are actually character arcs the reason i m even considering checking out another book by him is because he wrote no country for old men which i loved the movie for i never saw the movie for the road but i actually think the substance would probably make a better movie than a book i guess i just don t like having to stop and stew over cryptic imagery and metaphors i felt that the world building wasn t even that great because it was all just so bleak it s pretty easy to imagine a gray ashy wasteland but i felt most of the book was painting this repetitive imagery as well as posing the question is survival worth it when the world has become a barren pit of despair which for me was easy to arrive at the answer of no their attempts at survival seemed pretty pointless there seemed to be no carefree joy to be experienced and the only point in surviving would be to satisfy the innate urge to propagate our dna the road seemed to take a few cool concepts like the characters not having names and the conversation being drab and hopeless to match the environment and just stretching that out way longer than was actually interesting i just started another book wool by hugh howey that achieves great literary devices with straightforward language max barry s providence and machine man made me think so hard without being frivolous so after reading my post should i read any other cormac mccarthy,1,0.88,0.12,0.88,0.12

my son and i have been having arguments over a helmet and wrist guards pls help my child and i have been having an argument which has lasted for about days on whether or not he should have to wear a helmet and wrist guards when riding a penny board which he really wants to buy a pennyboard is a skateboard that is not meant for tricks like your traditional ones but rather is designed only to take you places quickly and easily search it up if you want a more specific description things to keep in mind is that my husband and i have a pretty difficult relationship with my year old son over things that we keep on disagreeing on i have screamed at him and threw something at him in spite of the situation which i missed my husband has fought with him with just a few scratches on him and rips in his shirt to calm him down and my son has been verbally abusive telling us to piss off leave me alone go to hell and stop being such an a hole etc etc also my husband has realized that being physical was him was wrong and has successfully prevented himself from having physical altercations with him so far on the first day my son came to me with the proposal of him of using his own money to buy the pennyboard and if he could use my credit card to order it on amazon since he does not have one of his own now the first time my husband and i told him that if he wanted to use my credit card to buy his pennyboard he would also have to buy his own helmet and wrist guard and wear it at all times now after some negotiating we decided that instead of him using his own money to buy the helmet and wrist guards we would buy it for him he would still use his money to buy the pennyboard if he was ever caught riding it without it atleast for the first months we would confiscate and destroy it which were the exact words we used when we wrote the contract to legitamize the deal in reaction to that my son thought that that was extremely unfair since it was his money and repeatedly asked if there was anything he could do to lessen the extremity of the deal and make it less harsh on him specifically he first asked if instead of completely destorying the pennyboard if he was ever caught without it we would just confiscate it and used the example of thats like having a year old life sentence over accidently running a red light with no casualties to go along with it we still stood to our ground and basically ignored him and said that their was nothing for us to do and if you don t like the terms of our deal then he would just be able to suck it up and leave it be this argument has been one of the longest most tramatizing we have ever had and we are asking for sincere honest comments and advice to help deal with this situation in the comment section below,0,0.01,0.99,0.01,0.01

trust issue with caretaker my son yr has been telling us since day that he broke something at his new caregivers house and she yelled at him for background he has been going to her for about a month he has been cared for by my mil since birth full time he still goes to mil two days a week to the new caretaker days a week and stays home with us the rest of the week anyway his broken item story has changed to the other little boy broke something and i broke it and hid it or i don t know what i broke but the common thread of something being broken and the woman yelling has been around since the first day also for background he always says he does not want to go to her house he cries every day he has to go i asked her about it the next day and offered to replace whatever it was and she said he didn t break anything so i let it go this morning however my son was having a really bad crying episode about having to go there and i decided to ask her if i could come in and assist my son in finding the broken item to give to her if this is a real thing i told him i would be with him and she would not be upset with him it would be okay etc if it s not a real thing at least we would be able to put it to rest i texted her to ask about minutes prior to arrival but she didn t see it when i showed up at her door i explained the situation and asked if it was okay for me to come in and look with him to give it to her since he was scared she said no no he didn t break anything there is nothing that he could have broken she said it s fine and held out her hand for him to come to her which he did although he was crying still i understand she could have just been trying to calm him down and end the situation so i could leave and go to work but i felt like she dismissed my feelings and his i find it bizarre that i couldn t come into her home at least for a couple minutes to soothe his anxieties over the situation and talk it through with her present especially since he is the only child there for at least another minutes my mom thinks i should discuss this with her but i am feeling like this is such a deal breaker that i now do not have any trust and want to just discontinue services i am aware that my son might be making this entire thing up his imagination is very active right now but not letting me in felt off how would you feel in this situation am i being too harsh should i trust my gut amp x b tldr caretaker did not allow me inside her house to find item my son allegedly broke,0,0.14,0.86,0.14,0.14

no longer human is harder to read through than i d like to admit should i keep going tl dr one single chapter is killing my motivation to keep reading and it s the longest one too i decided to read this book because i had read some references from a mobile game called alter ego and the name was intriguing prologue and first chapter great interesting setting and hyped to see how the protagonist was going to break down the nd chapter however is just a pain not only is it the longest chapter but also i think the rambling goes on and on for way too much time maybe it s because i have started reading as a hobby again after many years but truly as much as i m interested i can t get used to the pacing the formatting is weird too the nd chapter is almost as long as the half of the book because there are roughly chapters prologue included and that s it perhaps i m just not used to reading psychology focused books whatever the reason may be should i keep going does it get better,1,0.96,0.04,0.96,0.040000000000000036
writer aspirations making it harder to read as a hobby sorry if this post is a little long but this has been weighing me down for a while now i ve always dreamed of being a writer or at least some other form of storyteller in large part because i ve always loved reading but now that i m starting to take serious steps towards becoming one i e studying for it in college beginning to practice a bit more i m finding it suddenly very difficult to enjoy what i m reading like i focus too much on the technical aspects of the story instead of just reading it i get hung up on specific word choices that i don t like and my mind constantly compares the act of reading to watching movies and makes me feel like whatever the story is i d rather just see it in a movie though when i briefly considered making movies instead i found this made me not feel like watching movies either i ll constantly be finding a new book saying to myself oh this ll be the book i really like i m sure of it and then putting it down after a few pages this even happens to books i ve read before and absolutely loved the last time which is even more frustrating i always figured this was just an extension of my ocd and it probably is but i saw some comments on this subreddit of people who had similar experiences to me and it gave me the idea to ask here for help how can i reignite my passion for reading how can i follow my dreams of becoming a professional writer without turning reading into a chore as a result any answers would be well appreciated,1,0.99,0.01,0.99,0.010000000000000009

how do you handle the guilt how often do you play and entertain your child i m a stay at home mom with a year old before the shutdown we were really busy always volunteering for animal rescues always at people s houses in the summer on weekends so we could be in the pool always at stores and target we also spent a ton of time outside the past month i am just beyond mentally exhausted right now i m crying because i feel like the worst mom ever i m weeks pregnant and he begs for me to play with him when he s awake he always wants me on his level on the floor playing pretend and making action figures talk it s exhausting and i m tired and sore and heavy i physically can t get on the floor anymore and if i say i can t play he will be upset and say he s lonely normally i d take him outside but no kidding it s been the most wet and humid month ever we can t spend time in the yard without it being flooded or being eaten alive by mosquitoes i do try to play and interact with him as much as possible while still doing laundry and dishes and cleaning but it s so hard i don t want to play pretend and make things talk or fight i honestly just want to do house work and sleep my husband comes home and plays with him for a few hours but its never enough for him and he doesn t really self entertain its too risky for us to go to indoor play places and most of the people who we know are antivax and don t wear masks and i can t risk us getting sick while this far along i just don t know how to get over the guilt or have him play by himself he has an entire play room but hes not interested in it at all unless i m in there playing as well my husband is amazing he cooks and helps me with both my son and housework hes also home days a week to play with my son so it s not like hes lacking attention the things i can easily do like read or color aren t interesting for him he wants me to be sitting down and bending down and squatting and i try but i am just so tired so mentally drained,0,0.06,0.94,0.06,0.06

why are there no youtube channels about books that are not booktubers i have no issue with booktubers truly their content just isn t what i tend to look for for movies there are wonderful youtube channels like like stories of old and accented cinema and such that look at movies from an analytical and cultural perspective for music there s theneedledrop who does great reviews of albums with the perspective of someone who truly knows their stuff but i just can t seem to find anything like this for books the closest i ve come is better than food and he is fantastic why aren t there others like him i understand that there are likely a few other channels in that style but unless i ve been horribly unlucky in my search they are usually quite small and have poor production albums are a long winded non visual artform and yet there are many discussion channels about them books are obviously popular contrary to what articles like to scream about so there is likely an audience are book snobs just not looking for content on the internet i suppose it makes sense to read reviews instead but it just seems like an untapped market,1,0.69,0.31,0.69,0.31000000000000005

lizaveta in crime amp punishment minor crime amp punishment spoilers lizaveta minor c amp p spoilers crime and punishment is widely considered a masterpiece and the definitining psychological thriller it s used as a benchmark by which every other psychological drama thriller is compared against explicitly or otherwise and it s a great book i ve read it several times and immensely enjoyed it it would appear on a surface level and after scrutiny that dostoevsky has a near perfect understanding of the psychology of those pushed to desperation however for a psychological study it has a glaring hole which only becomes more clear the more intensely you read the book lizaveta throughout the novel raskolnikov is broken down by guilt for his crime however he only ever seems to muse on the death of alyona alyona the brutal pawnbroker in large part responsible for the maintained poverty and misery of whole blocks of the poorest parts of st petersburg is who he feels worst over the lady who was also financially and probably emotionally abusing her sister in law lizaveta this woman had what would be the equivalent of years of salary a salary well beyond those around her too no less tucked away in her apartment gathering dust to be donated to some monastery or another upon her death lizaveta was just there at the wrong moment and was generally liked lizaveta s death should be what torments rodya but it s not that strikes me as a critical oversight in dostoevsky s psychology of guilt beyond that what purpose does lizaveta serve to die and just be forgotten about a few pages later granted towards the end it is revealed that sonya and lizaveta were friends to an extent thus tying sonya to rodya s crime directly but even during and after the encounter where this is revealed rodya doesn t seem concerned with lizaveta his thoughts are preoccupied with the crime as an action and with alyona and from the writer s end it would ve been quite easy for sonya to have prayed with alyona in the past instead removing that weak reason for her existence in the story perhaps she was there to add collateral damage to his crime but if that was the case wouldn t it have been wiser for her to have remained in the other room throughout the crime and for rodya to encounter her in passing later in the story that encounter could prompt some incredible dialogue and psychological machinations we readers know dostoevsky can deliver had lizaveta stayed in the other room or maybe was out shopping at the time it would have changed and even amplified raskolnikov s crime he would ve murdered an old and embittered woman and stolen from one of her many victims as lizaveta is frequently described his crime would ve left a more enduring and visible mark in his daily life and again encounters between the two would be incredible but it s fair to argue that well rodya doesn t think about alyona so much as he does the activity of crime murder fair but then why does rodya only seem to think about alyona maybe he s too terrified of what he did to lizaveta but that doesn t sound very on brand or realistic for raskolnikov it s fair to argue that well he s concerned with alyona because she was the source of his motive if that s the case then why isn t he shredded by thoughts of his totally innocent motive less victim because he isn t in the novel he s primarily thinking about alyona or the crime as a whole almost never about lizaveta specifically whereas he spends a great deal of time thinking exclusively about alyona in fact you d be forgiven for forgetting about her completely maybe the narrator hides these thoughts from us but if so why on earth would they it s my opinion that lizaveta is a hole leftover from the nature of dostoevsky s writing style he was known for publishing novels in serialized installments without having an especially firm grasp or plan on the direction of the story a style that very nearly got him in serious trouble with his novel the brothers karamazov in the grand inquisitor chapter especially it s my opinion that lizaveta died and was forgotten about because of the manner in which dostoevsky wrote crime and punishment i ve read the novel in its entirety twice and have read and reread many chapters and scenes for a literature class and for my own enjoyment and thought i ve read and am familiar with many of dostoevsky s other works and generally love his style and stories though i personally can t stand the kirkegaardian leaps of faith required to maintain dostoevsky s orthodoxy they re fun brain pushups to refute though i even really enjoyed reading crime and punishment and i agree that it has earned all the praise afforded it however lizaveta is as far as i can figure a plot hole a plot hole that s been weighing on me for quite a while now maybe that s why she isn t explored to leave it as a psychological exercise for the reader am i missing something does this bother anyone else i m happy to elaborate too i m just really curious what y all think about lizaveta in crime and punishment also sorry if formatting is ugly i m on mobile and not tech savvy,1,0.89,0.11,0.89,0.10999999999999999

adult books at my school we always have to differentiate between books for children young adults and adults one thing i don t understand is that why are adult books almost always leaning on the sex and depression side why is the language always so hard to understand why does the theme either have to be a comedy or have a serious topic otherwise it s childish can t we have adult books that use a simpler language and have a light hearted theme it s something that always bothered me because we have to make book essays for school for which we obviously need to pick books for but even if i search for hours in our school s big library i can barely find a decent high level adult book we are forced to look in that category that doesn t make feel me sad bored or disgusted by the unnecessary graphic sex scenes what is your opinion about this,1,0.83,0.17,0.83,0.17000000000000004

um soap and shampoo necessary right my husband just had a screaming fight with me because i objected to him not using soap or shampoo when bathing our toddler after he d peed the bed my feeling is it s pretty much a standard part of bath time and when he was a baby and we did baths together he always used soap i had no idea that now that we re taking turns he s not using soap apparently my husband himself does not use soap or shampoo most or all of the time and since the pandemic has mostly stopped using deodorant this explains his frequent shirt changes and funkiness but i honestly thought it was because he was doing more around the house but now he s saying he thinks no one should be using soap and shampoo or deodorant it s unnecessary and harmful to the skin hair and wasteful and he s intending to continue to not use it and to teach our son not to use it going forward i m completely taken aback at all of this this is like stepping into bizarro world i said what s going to happen when he s going to school and he smells bad and the kids tease him and he says you can t live your life in fear we can t protect him from everything just because you were bullied doesn t mean you have to raise him to be afraid but like this is batshit right we use soap right or am i crazy and we all went soapless during the pandemic and i missed the memo somehow,0,0.05,0.95,0.05,0.05

what is the most beautifully written character death you ve ever read about a month ago i read the ember blade by chris wooding and the character deaths in it are still something i think about gt keel s suicide lt was such a brutal event that fell totally in line with the slow degrading of his character throughout the story gt garric giving up hope and embracing violence lt was something tragically realistic as you d want the character to hold true to the promises they made and be a hero but his early belief in his country and the people in it slowly morphed into something fueled by hate and destruction but the real tragedy here was of course gt cade lt his death was heartbreaking on many levels not least of which being how drawn out it was and how he chose to do it to save his friends the line this time you re not leaving me behind i m leaving you spoke to the problems he and his best friend had brewing but that his love for him was what mattered most so while thinking about it i started to wonder what other scenes i ve read that have amazing character deaths which inspired me to ask what scenes have you read that stay in your head which characters live on for you after their deaths,1,0.87,0.13,0.87,0.13

daycare issues advice on how to handle my year old is usually so happy to go with the flow hasn t really cried at daycare drop off other than the first week at months old this morning he absolutely bawled his eyes out clung to me for dear life and hid his face this is totally unlike him and i m paranoid because imo behaviour talks i ruled out the usual reasons for a tantrum he slept well ate his breakfast even though they were already offering some yogurt and berries as a snack which he loves and refused the only things i can think of is either he doesn t wanna go cause he bumped his head yesterday or he wanted to home and read his new books or he s not happy with something or someone there which i m trying to not assume because he s usually so happy there i got him to calm down and walk with one of the daycare providers to go find a book my mistake was i had to sign him in and he basically had to go through a nd goodbye with me he bawled again and the daycare provided tried to get him to keep walking i know why she did it but i don t like basically abandoning him while he s crying for me keeping in mind this is not his usual behaviour typically he s gone and just goes see ya i feel like i should have just taken him home i have a day off which i was going to use to clean the house but now i feel very guilty,0,0.15,0.85,0.15,0.15
what s a great quote from a horrible book i was reading on writing the other day brilliant book and while i was reading i couldn t help but take note of a page or two where stephen king detailed h p lovecraft s dialogue essentially saying that it was garbage although besides dialogue writing h p lovecraft was great at his forgive me craft that got me to thinking about some examples where the dialogue or a character driven bit of prose is amazing one or two times in an otherwise awful book the opposite of h p lovecraft s bad dialogue in otherwise brilliant books can you think of any examples,1,0.96,0.04,0.96,0.040000000000000036
my year old s friend died very unexpectedly from an undiagnosed tumor how to tell them my kiddo s friend from daycare who they were very close with died very suddenly this week my kiddo just started first grade and the other kid was supposed to start this week as well they have been close all growing up through our local daycare not to disrupt the first week too much we have elected to not tell them until this afternoon when they get home from school how on earth do you find the words to break the news to them in as graceful way as possible we cannot not tell them for a multitude of reasons it needs to be done where do you find the words for that conversation we re not a religious family so the concept of heaven and afterlife is not part of our household we are planning to be careful with the words we use we re planning on saying that their brain was hurt and not say things like tumor sick cancer etc because we don t want to put even more anxiety on them they re the type of kid that holds on to words and worry we have decided to go to the funeral ourselves parents to offer condolences to the family and to leave our kids at home for a few reasons firstly we we think that them playing together should be their last memories other parents of these kids friend circle agree they won t be there either we don t want to soil the memory of their friend with a practice that they might not fully understand not at yo anyway also more importantly out of respect for the kid s parents just not be surrounded by kids the age of the one they just lost help us find the right words to this difficult conversation we had to put down a family dog that i ve had since long before we we re married about years ago so death isn t completely foreign to them but this is the first close person to them that has passed away i m really worried about this conversation this afternoon and finding the right words to ease it as much as possible,0,0.14,0.86,0.14,0.14
hi i m new to this sub and looking for suggestions of high quality books to read my modern preferences definitely tend to lean more towards fiction fantasy sci fi but i m pretty open to any well made and cohesive writing with older books my preferences vary a bit more widely i ve found myself enjoying a variety of alexander dumas huxley s brave new world bits of twain mostly anything besides jane eyre or shakespeare apologies to a large group of people they just feel slow to me i m looking to get into a bit of writing again for the first real shot since high school and i ve always found myself more inclined to write after seeing the ways in which some skilled authors manage to manipulate elements of the story to their advantage so looking for any books you guys may have enjoyed or that surprised you with particularly well written turns of phrase revelations etc,1,0.92,0.08,0.92,0.07999999999999996

my children are out of control and i blame my wife i apologize in advance for what may end up being a disjointed post but this may end up being a stream of conscience for my own sanity i have boys and and they are both complete monsters they can be super sweet to other people but to me and my wife they are horrible they don t listen they talk back and they throw fits anytime they don t get there way i believe all of this is my wife s fault we never discussed that she would be a stay at home mom but after our first born she just never went back to work with the price of child care it wasn t the worst idea at the time but looking back it absolutely was the worst idea my wife read way to many parenting books and had all these ideas of what a good parent was supposed to be that she never figured out how to actually parent that coupled with untreated post partum depression and it became a terrible combination she has always tried harder to be their friend then their mom she never wanted to punish instead she wanted to use all the bs grungy hippy mom crap that dissuaded actual punishment i don t mean she should have beat our kids but actually enforce consequences she threatens the counting to a billion times but as god as my witness has never made it to it s always then repeats it s so infuriating from the outside she was also never one to let them cry not to sleep or not ever so even the year old has to be laid with to sleep it s incredibly frustrating because it can take hours to get them to sleep we go over to friend s houses any they send their yo to bed while my wife and i have have to battle for a couple hours just to get them to sleep when the kids are alone with just me it s a completely different story they know i don t fuck around and when daddy says to do something it better get done so why don t i do that when she s around you may ask well i do but they just go whine to her and she ends up find a creative way to cave to them the best is did you try asking your dad nicely it s basically code for go ask him again and he ll say yes they simple know there is no consequences when mommy is around they can do whatever the fuck they want and act like wild animals and still get their way if they whine enough sure i ve tried talking to her about it both very directly and more nuanced when i m direct she gets defensive and plays the martyr same as she does with and criticism she gets when i try to be more subtle she tends to agree with the fact that we need to make some changes those changes last a week maybe a most before everything reverts back to the old ways the other thing is screen time fucking screen time specifically on a phone they are always whining for it and she inevitably caves just last week we talked about keeping them off phones for a week and it didn t even last a day again with me they get a couple shows a day usually when i m trying to cook dinner and that s it what is she doing while they are on the phone of the time she is sitting on the couch with them on her phone she spends hours a day on facebook and tik tok both families mine and hers see the problem they know the boys are only going to get worse they see that i have no say but what are they supposed to do they can t say shit to her either i feel like my kids are going to grow up to be assholes and i feel like it s all her fault,0,0.1,0.9,0.1,0.1
first day of kindergarten panic dropping my kid off was a sweet sentimental moment i didn t want to leave them i told the office and teacher i was picking them up and they both said ok teacher was sending pictures and updates on how their day was going they was having a blast when school was dismissed the kids were coming out in groups well apparently different kindergarten classes come out in different doors so after waiting at the first door i seen a lot of kids come out and i was about the only one standing until someone told me sometimes kindergarteners come out another door so i ran down there i seen a student who was in their class but not my kid so i asked if all the class got dismissed and the other said yeah then i kinda just walked in there cause my kids classroom was close by the door and no one was in there i found their teacher and i said hey did go outside or did they get on the bus she said they got on the bus which made my heart drop i said no word and ran and ran to my car i probably looked crazy i told everyone at the school i was picking them up i drove down to the bus stop they were suppose to get off and waited and then i called the bus company and said their bus was running behind when i saw their face get off i felt instantly better the bus driver and the person who answered the phone for the company said if there was no adults at the stop they wouldn t just drop them off and take them back to school which made me feel better but i noticed that they didnt have their lunch box i said hey where s your lunch box they replied with i left it at school it was a cute reply but i m just thinking seriously youd think the teacher would remember to give that to them so i drove back to the school i got it and it seems like another kid forgot theirs too i guess i m just really worried that the teacher is just gonna forget them somewhere or leave them on accident i was afraid that they was gonna get off the wrong bus stop this is my first kids first day of schoo ever so it s all new to me and them the bus stop is a block and down the road from my house and they are the only kid on the stop i tried calling if they could get a closer and of course no they can t,0,0.07,0.93,0.07,0.07

my tunnel book story amp x b my tunnel book story by francis edwards amp x b ten years ago my mission began with a commitment to myself and family never to give up the dream of making the tunnel book a reality this is what happens to many dreamers you become obsessed with an idea and just won t let it go the dream invades our brain and compels us forever forward every creator of the written word must feel this as it becomes an obsession to write or perish many people want to write but are afraid they don t become obsessed the dream does not enter their being i am not afraid i am determined i was told a long time ago that i was not college material i was devastated my grandmother who reared me gave me advise that there is always a back door i attended night school to prove that i could handle learning i was allowed to transfer to day school i graduated with a teaching certificate from the university of pittsburgh pennsylvania this was a big deal but i never really wanted to teach i ended up doing a lot of different diverse activities to make a buck during those years that led up to my obsession with the tunnel book i pursued adventures in self employment that covered such areas as cafe owner real estate broker inn keeper antiques store owner events promoter to running an art gallery at years of age my uncle planted the seed to challenge me to accomplish the task of completing my educational level by pursuing a master s degree what could i accomplish with this degree i was watching pbs an american tv broadcasting show called antiques road show from the uk when one person presented a victorian tunnel book a souvenir to be evaluated fireworks exploited i could brainstorm this possibility the format of a tunnel book could be used and adapted for children s books tunnel books could be used for learning and inspiring children to like books and reading my dream was set i could put all my efforts from gaining a master s degree in the science of learning from scranton university to use my research of the tunnel book from sources such as wikipedia revealed that the concept was used a long time ago the tunnel book s design in germany in the s was constructed out of wood wooden frames were slitted into a wooden box which created a d diorama presentation our victorians re discovered the tunnel book they maybe added a peephole and did make it from paper to be sold commercially as souvenirs for the tourist trade back then the tunnel book depicted a d keepsake of special events and places like the one i saw on pbs of princess street edinburgh scotland with it s beautiful castle in the background i became besotted according to wikipedia the tunnel book also was used for illustrations of the human anatomy as well as illustrations of theater stage settings which made the tunnel book for adults and not children my struggles to make a tunnel book paid off i took substitute school positions in elementary schools in polk county florida to show off my creations i became a pied piper children began to look for me at all the different schools and when i was spotted they always asked me if i had a new tunnel book to share with them i was carefully shrewd enough never to ask permission from the shoool s main office if it was permissible to show a tunnel book for the fear of being turned down the children loved them and encouraged me always to make another title the market research was done after five years most people do not know what a tunnel book is wikipedia doesn t even give the book it s own main heading they list it under pop up books tunnel books are a series of cut paper panels placed one behind the other which creates an illusion of depth and perspective the books are engineered like an accordion two boards are pulled apart revealing the illustrated panels or frames that are lined up and viewed through a front peephole the concept is old but i have done a modern day innovation by adding stories or informative information attached to the front of the book this has never been done before the book was never intended for children the book does compete with internet games that attract a child s attention tunnel books can inspire a like for books and reading as well as entertain they belong into the hands of children educators should use them as a new tool for delivering learning in schools my mission would come to life the tunnel book now had to be moved forward into the public domain the school children suggested i should seek out the investors on shark tank off to miami florida i went there were hundreds of people snaked around the convention hall all lining up to show their new innovations i jumped the que and sat on a wall close to the entrance of the hall my arthritis was acting up so much that i could not stand for hours on end people on the wall sensed my pain and made room for me out of the hall came assistants with different color bracelets for us that indicated a designated time slot for presentations once in side our group was informed that the sharks were only interested in our pitch and not our product or item i did not know what a pitch was i had no pitch prepared sweat started to form nerves started to make me shake i suddenly decided to read them a compassion letter a student composed urging me to seek funding from the sharks i never heard from them i implemented plan b do a big book fair tunnel books were vetted to appear at the miami international book fair my stand was located on the street that led book lovers right to the food carts they only had their hungry urge to satisfy however a call came through when i drove the miles to get home the caller said he could put my books in stores across america please send me one to show he called again and confessed he could not show the book because it was hand made i then of course implemented plan c lakeland florida has a beautiful convention hall this hometown of mine is located about half way between tampa bay and disney land yes i called the events coordinators at the hall and they fitted me a slot for a book fair to fill in a cancelled event news releases were sent my book fair also needed local support lots and lots of good books were given to stores to hide this treasure hunt to find a book would result in a free admission ticket to the book fair posters were made and posted all over town if hay on wye could have a book fair so could lakeland three months of sending out announcements to publishing houses authors and illustrators resulted in one signed contract plan c was quickly abandoned i didn t really feel so bad about the treasure hunt as those people who found a book got to keep them one merchant who had a hidden book said that a book fair would never work here in lakeland since this is a culturally deprived wasteland this being the reality i wanted to move how to accomplish a move in selling up during a depressed real estate market write a book called tattle tale talk and win a family home the idea was to write a best seller and sell so many copies i could give my house away at a random draw like many things in life the idea backfired but i became a published author with two books available for purchase on amazon by i was stuck in lakeland my family realized my many disappointments in life so they encouraged me to finish my work education i took a deep breath and applied for a master s degree in the science of learning at scranton university pennsylvania at years of age after earning the degree i discovered the tunnel book my hand made creation dinosaurs let me see a tunnel book was posted for sale on amazon backing up and moving to the land of charles dickens made sense to me i know he had his struggles in england but i still craved to be immersed in culture the publishers association in england sponsored me a free booth at the bologna book fair in italy seizing this great opportunity to exhibit my titles of tunnel books off i went with my faithful supporter a year old uncle seeing my tunnel books all displayed at the book fair was wonderful however things changed quickly when my frail uncle had an accident he dumped his bowls on the exhibition floor i had to evacuate him back to england abandoning the book fair now i have put my head back into my shell waiting for the re emergence of normality i have been pushed to writing ebooks as a way of connecting to the outside world i will never give up my dream seriously i want my tunnel books under the spot light i don t want you hanging here without telling you that my dream is emerging once more with etsy i am under their spot light with my listings of tunnel books etsy provides an outlet for all things handmade and unique to the marketplace i am ecstatic amp x

how do you usually interpret a book do you come up with your own interpretation and analysis do you read critical reviews i m asking because i was taught in school that most of the time there s a valid interpretation for every book you can either agree with that valid interpretation s or you basically talk nonsense for example if i want to discuss about the stranger by a camus i should talk about absurdity existential nihilism life with no objective meaning a protagonist which does not agree with societal values and principles only to emphasize the absurdity of our world and so on in this case how much am i allowed to come up with my own interpretation what if i want to believe that camus only wanted to show us how a sociopath lives and that s all or even worse what if i want to believe that camus wrote fiction without any hidden meanings actually,1,0.8,0.2,0.8,0.19999999999999996

how do you absorb the information from books i have a really difficult time retaining the plot lines of books i will look back on books i ve read on my goodreads from only a year ago and would not be able to summarize the plot if someone asked me what it was about most books i can remember having read them by the cover and can tell if i generally liked the book or hated it but the names of main characters what actually happens in the book and the end generally escape me i have heard this isn t all that uncommon but it drives me crazy i decided for the next book i picked up i would try to be more active about remembering it lol i ve taken to jotting down notes and little chapter summaries to try and retain what i read i ve also seen advice that says to not engage in too much marathon reading as that generally is forcing the brain to hold it in your working memory as opposed to setting the book down and coming back to it later makes you recall the story multiple times and therefore reinforcing it any tips or tricks you guys have or maybe just let me know i m not the only one so i don t feel completely out of my wits,1,0.86,0.14,0.86,0.14

think and grow rich by napoleon hill general overview think and grow rich is a collection of the steps required to accumulate riches distilled from studying over wealthy and successful individuals over the course of years this book is about getting results in areas you focus the most before i started reading this book and throughout reading it it s sort of a habit to check the reviews on reddit to see what other people think about it the majority of the reviews were negative so here is my opinion on it despite the fact that the author napoleon hill may be a fraud since there isn t any record of him meeting the american industrialist and business tycoon andrew carnegie and even being asked for a project for years from andrew carnegie doesn t make sense gt carnegie biographer david nasaw stated that he found no evidence of any sort that carnegie and hill ever met that doesn t mean that the book is bad in any way it has some practical lessons and plans to get what you desire i know that you hear this everyday think about something and work hard for it no matter what and you will achieve what you desire but there was some practicality in this book the author mentioned plans and steps that when applied helps you achieve your goals he also stated the traits of a successful leader and how to avoid being an oppressor by presenting the traits that should be avoided i liked the idea of emotionalizing thoughts which motivates you to work on your goal even though this book is about accumulating riches its philosophy could be applied to achieve any goal i really liked his style of writing i loved the way that each chapter contains spaced well formatted paragraphs i m not a fan of cramming words into pages without styling my favorite paragraph which opened my mind is gt prayer does sometimes result in the realization of that for which one prays if you have ever had the experience of receiving that for which you prayed go back in your memory and recall your actual state of mind while you were praying i wish i could fully explain what i mean but when you pray you have faith that god will answer your prayer and that motivates you to work hard for the thing you are praying for that s what i understood from this paragraph and that makes a lot of sense to me i m curious to know other people s opinions on this book what do you think about it is it a good book with a bad author any other opinion,1,0.97,0.03,0.97,0.030000000000000027

thoughts on the writing in the kite runner maybe i m too used to reading mccarthy and grrm and such but having just finished the kite running and even liking it quite a bit i was struck by how the author spells everything out to you multiple times he ll set something up and have a payoff only to explain the payoff to you the story itself and characters are really good and of course that is what will ultimately weigh the most when judging a book but still it all felt so amateurish to me and i don t wanna get into any spoilers but for example there was this character in the story that never did a certain thing and then near the end of the story he does said thing and it s an amazing scene but then the narrator spells it out for you and then goes into some metaphor and a whole monologue about it and that just really took away from the moment but of course you don t have to go way in the other direction like mccarthy and have basically no internal monologue but at least in my opinion when you need to ruminate on this stuff it just makes for a more satisfying story plus i ve just never been a big fan of the all knowing narrator thingy in books i e that was the last time i d see him in two years not that it s necessarily bad and i ve seen it done well but i just think it s the simplest way you can write a story i ve noticed this in my own writing as this style is something i ve actively had to fight myself against doing because it s just so natural to write a story this way but it makes your book read like you re listening to grandpa tell you a story from his past rather than an epic fictional tale and again i still liked the book and certainly don t regret reading it as it both taught me a lot about afghanistan and it was clear that the author had a lot of knowledge in that area and i don t think anyone else could ve written this story but i almost feel like this book is just this popular because of the graphic content in it as opposed to being some modern masterpiece i didn t feel like it did anything that special or different except for the really dark stuff in it,1,0.98,0.02,0.98,0.020000000000000018
authors who are passionate hello i m not much of an avid reader but i want to be my main problem with most with books that sound interesting is that the description and world building is so clinical for example dune sounds so interesting but the tone is so cold and melancholy i have a shorter attention span than most so books where pacing comes to a halt to over explain the scenery is excruciating when that happens i have to re read the same paragraph several times because my brain flat lines dose anyone have fun emotionally investing books to recommend thank you i really appreciate it,1,0.96,0.04,0.96,0.040000000000000036

new to reading fiction hello fellow bookworms so basically i am a doctor have spent my life reading nothing bar fact fact fact since i was about the last fiction book i read was of mice and men in school i know shocking i had a random flashback of how actually i really enjoyed gcse english but was caught up in doing medicine and neglected anything that wasn t directly medicine related i remembered the times when i was reading an inspector calls omam etc and i really enjoyed them so this motivated me to get back into fiction i thought that a good place for me to start would be with omam again loved the book and want to rejog my memory of it i went on amazon got it second hand for i ended up getting attacked by marketing and left the website with of mice and men the grapes of wrath east of eden i have to wait for them to come in the post but wanted to get reading today so i went into town and picked up animal farm by orwell and am going to start with it today i ve come to this page for some help really i haven t read a book in so long that i m not really sure how to ofc i can just sit down and read it but wondered if it would be best for me to look at images of the areas in the books before reading or if i should let my imagination just draw its own picture should i read up on what the point of the book is first look up what the book tells me about society blah blah or if i should just go at it alone and see for myself i guess the answer is fairly obvious but i wondered if some experienced readers have any advice on how i should be reading ps any books you think i should buy i m going to read these four but if anyone has any pointers of really good books to read then let me know i love the british particularly welsh countryside farming american old west stuff similar to omam and wildlife definitely not interested in anything medical at all any advice is welcome,1,0.88,0.12,0.88,0.12
audiobooks reasons to make the switch what started as another way for boomers to mock millennials look at them charging their books is now an evergrowing trend audiobooks and e books have taken the markets by storm and it s become rare for a popular book to not become an audiobook at some point they have grown so popular that apparently they now make up around of all book sales in the usa and yet many people still stick to the classic paperbacks not that it s a bad thing we can all agree that it s a very enjoyable activity to sit with a good book and simmer in the experience but since our lives have been growing more and more chaotic there remains little room for reading so even if people know all the reasons to read more as a rule of thumb a lot of them simply don t and that s where audiobooks come in to make it easier for you to make the switch from a non reader to an avid reader i have been dabbling with audiobooks since the beginning of the year and so far i have read more like listened to books a few of which i didn t finish or am yet to finish i can say first hand as a young adult who used to read a lot when i was a kid audiobooks have really transformed me and brought back the joy of getting deep into a storyline and world unlike our own the list of benefits is long and some of the benefits you would get even if you read normal paper books so if you are still on the verge between normal books and audiobooks read ahead here s a list of reasons to make the switch all benefits are in this article,1,0.75,0.25,0.75,0.25
how to tell my cousin she is not doing a good job raising her kids she is the kind of mother who walks away from a child in the middle of a tantrum she leaves the poor child in distress when she should show compassion and understanding leaving your year old child in distress alone in the middle of a street repeatedly can cause a child to develop bad coping mechanisms that will transfer to the child s adult life i also noticed her mocking her children when they are upset i don t see her and her family often but when i do all these red flags come up i am not a mother myself and maybe is none of my business but i feel like i have to say something so my nephews don t end up with a serious case of childhood trauma i don t want my cousin to feel like she is a bad mother by telling her how to raise her children i don t have any experience in raising children myself so maybe it is not in my power to say anything at all should i say something and if yes how to say it with compassion and respect,0,0.08,0.92,0.08,0.08

tight spines and sharp edges hi i ve recently realize that indie books and traditionally published books paperbacks don t have the same quality in terms of their design a few days ago i bought an indie published paperback and it s edges are really sharp paper cut sharp and the spine is really tight too i basically have to break it in order to be comfortable with the book i don t usually have problems like that with my other books because they tend to be floppy and soft i ve come to the conclusion that i took the physical quality of a book because i hadn t realized how drastically it could impact my reading experience have ever had that problem if so how do you counter it my main problem is for the sharp edges i don t mind breaking the spines sorry i know that s a big pet peeve in the bookish community so do you guys have techniques that you use to avoid getting paper cuts from super sharp edges while reading and or a way to possibly soften the edges of a book thank you so much to anyone who took the time to read and or respond to my post,1,0.94,0.06,0.94,0.06000000000000005

spoilers i thought was awful am i crazy there s very little about the book i enjoyed what i did like was the prose and atmosphere but everything else not really it was at least engaging enough for me to enjoy my time with it but it had so many glaring flaws i just don t understand why it s so celebrated the characters were all incredibly flat there were only really three so i ll just break down why i disliked them winston was just an incel his main motivation seemed to be sex he didn t like that he wasn t free to have sex with whoever he wanted and he didn t like that there was the whole arc with his mother which was the most interesting part of his character and honestly the most relatable but i still wasn t a huge fan of it next up is julia holy shit julia is an awful character she s literally just a sex doll for winston she s not even a human and it s just downright offensive she serves two purposes in the book to open winston s eyes to the idea of revolution and to have sex with after the idea of revolution is introduced julia doesn t really do anything she kinda gets tossed aside she barely participates in the meeting with o brian has no interest in goldstein s book then just disappears for act yes she reappears at the very end as an important aside as to how she and winston were both reindoctrinated and let back into society but that s really all her character did then there s o brian o brian should ve been two characters so in the first two acts winston sees him as a friend and a fellow revolutionary which is fine i have no problems here he gives winston goldstein s book then becomes an interrogator in the ministry of love however it s previously established that o brian spends nearly all his time working in the ministry of truth how does o brian have time for both does he moonlight in the ministry of love does he suddenly switch careers i just didn t understand that part next is goldstein s book i hated everything about the book it s place in the narrative it s an entirely too long info dump chapter and also just felt insulting so it didn t need to exist let s start there i saw it as an excuse for orwell to explain how the rest of the world worked which i guess is fine but i wish it was done in a more compelling manner than what was essentially a textbook the problem is it didn t need to exist it just doesn t make sense from a narrative perspective it was previously established you don t need much evidence to convict someone or really any at all and the testimony of an inner party member and ministry of love interrogator should ve been enough to get winston arrested without the need for a book and a hidden telescreen in fact considering there was a telescreen in winston s secret room the entire time he should ve been arrested long ago for having said seditious things with julia but no we needed the book in addition the book felt insulting it didn t reveal that much new information i felt a lot of it was previously established or implied i ll admit it was interesting to hear about how the rest of the world is in an eternal stalemate for power and new weapons are constantly be developed that never go anywhere but everything else was kinda bland the interrogation scenes were fine they felt a little weird and disjointed though i suppose that was on purpose i just didn t like it and definitely didn t find it as compelling as the rest of the novel all that said i don t understand why the book is so celebrated animal farm and fahrenheit despite having it s own problems are just significantly more solid imo i just really hated the book and i wanted to know if i was alone in that i guess,1,0.8,0.2,0.8,0.19999999999999996

any dream can become a punishment the picture of dorian gray oscar wilde we all grow old from the very first minute of our life this irreversible process starts and in everyone s head has ever had the idea of eternal youth or the desire to slow down a little bit the changes that happen to our body gt the main character succeeded but at the same time he witnessed his own fading the portrait was changing but he remained young it would seem live and enjoy life you wanted it so much but for dorian gray his own dream became a curse lt the book which was written over a hundred years ago is so relevant that it gives you shivers because the author managed to create an eternal everything around is subject to change but the human essence with its vices and weaknesses remains the same this novel is saturated with selfishness greed and the desire to change this world but not for the common good but only for himself the tragedy of old age is not that one grows old but that one remains young at heart great quote but at the same time we see what happens if the opposite is true the body is our shell yes it s certainly an integral part of us but if a person knows you by sight that doesn t mean anything you can live your whole life with a person and not recognize him or her only when we are alone with ourselves do we become real everything else is a game with certain rules that s our life,1,0.77,0.23,0.77,0.22999999999999998

are there books besides the bible that use the bible setup in the bible sentences are arranged into verses a verse is identifiable by the book name chapter number and then sentence number for example the tenth sentence of the second chapter of the book of jonah would be called jonah this allows a verse to easily be referred to for example if someone asks a hypothetical enforcer how will you punish rebellion they might respond timothy which elongated says through the insincerity of liars whose consciences are seared so in effect they d be answering i look for signs of damaged conscience some versions of other spiritual books do the same such as the tripitaka which is the buddhist holy book this is either a very stupid question since there are millions of books in the world or a very good question since i don t know of any and nobody uses such books in the same way if there are any but are there ordinary everyday civilian books that use the same sentence method what other books are out there where if you were talking to someone who was book smart you could say a book chapter sentence number from that book like peter parker just a nonexistent example i m well aware spiderman isn t a prophet but peace upon him anyways to use as a shortcut and easter egg to get a point across,1,0.98,0.02,0.98,0.020000000000000018

how cynical is cormac mccarthy s world view in real life i just finished reading no country for old men for the first time it was my first mccarthy book and i really enjoyed it and am currently reading blood meridian one thing that seemed to really stand out and has always stood out to me in the past having watched the film a lot of times is that the book movie seems incredibly cynical it seems to imply basically that the world is completely ruthless and that goodness will be stamped out and that the evil can prevail maybe due to a decline in moral standards seems to be the sheriff s opinion or it could be many other reasons this has always seemed so hopeless and cynical and i m basically just wondering am i off the mark here i m new to trying to analyse my entertainment or is the book genuinely intended to be this cynical it seems like a very extreme message and i m also wondering if anyone knows what mccarthy s actual opinions are does the book genuinely reflect his feelings on the world maybe it s just more specifically about the cartel crime world but it seems more general i couldn t really find any interviews online with mccarthy that really address this or anything either way i love the story and i really don t mind cynicism i welcome it in fact it makes for a thoughtful gritty and interesting story imo just out of interest i would like to know if i m missing some more subtle optimistic stuff or something and how much much it really reflects the authors opinions,1,0.94,0.06,0.94,0.06000000000000005
year old having bathroom issues i was kind of hoping this would resolve itself naturally but it s gotten to the point now that i m going to need some input so here goes my year old son is having ongoing issues cleaning himself properly and effectively when using the washroom i m personally having a bit of a hard time with this as i and i imagine most have a pretty serious aversion to poop nearly every time without fail when my son uses the washroom to take a poop there is always some collateral damage he manages to get poop on the toilet toilet roll sink or some combination of things it s not like he s going in there and decimating the place but it s still a pretty big sanitary issue i get that he s young and mishaps can happen but this is pretty consistent and at this point i d be willing to say this goes above and beyond your average childhood mishap we ve had discussions i ve provided demonstrations and coaching and really exhausted every avenue i can think of without making the situation any more awkward or uncomfortable than it needs to be he has older siblings at mom s house and as such is moving toward independence a lot quicker than other boys his age and i m kind of at a loss for how to deal with this in a way that doesn t make things uncomfortable or unpleasant i don t really know where to go from here how can i address this in a way that won t make this a negative experience for him we did remote learning this year so it hasn t been too serious so far but this has got to get resolved before he returns to school in september because if not this is going to become a lot more problematic,0,0.18,0.82,0.18,0.18

the notebook i got into reading months ago and hadn t read romantic novels at all i also had some rough time before that and in general thought that such books won t grab me but i got some nicholas sparks books and i had heard about the notebook before so i started reading it and i finished it in one breath i m frankly amazed by how good it was and how it keeps you wanting more with every page the warmth and comfort sparks creates in the atmosphere the slow build up of the story the travelling through time via that exact same notebook all leave you appreciating and in awe of this novel the reference to the noah s ark who saves the animals the same way noah saves his wife from alzheimer with his daily reading of their life story the fact that their love is sacred and divine and defies even the toughest medical conditions makes the reader believe in true love and in the beauty of the world it is really moving and touches your soul especially in the last chapter where the hardships are at their best i d recommend the book to anyone whether or not you are a fan of that genre because as it is mentioned in it poetry s purpose is to touch the soul without being understood,1,0.92,0.08,0.92,0.07999999999999996
what are some of your most disappointing hyped up reads recently i ve tried to read a few titles that i didn t have time for during my grad school semester now that i am on a break i d had a list of several books i wanted to get through mostly because the reviews i d read or watched had been so good fast forward to a few weeks later and i m disappointed here s some i tried the deaths of evelyn hardcastle by stuart turton the only good indians by stephen graham jones mexican gothic by silvia moreno garcia shuggie bain by douglas stuart wilder girls by rory power burnt sugar by avni doshi none of them were total flops and most had a few redeeming qualities and in some the plot was great but the writing was not for me none were dnf ed but i just found that they were so much less than i was expecting the effusive reviews i d watched or read for so many months were not parallel to my own experience with any of these reads i was so excited for all of them and i didn t feel like they delivered anyhoo what were some of your most anticipated reads that ended up being lackluster,1,0.86,0.14,0.86,0.14
honestly i didn t get much out of siddhartha lately i ve been trying to return to my roots and get back into reading and my buddy loaned me his favorite book it wasn t anything i d ever heard of before siddhartha by herman hesse describes the journey a man named siddhartha takes to reach enlightenment my friend said this book helped guide him through personal struggles and i think that s awesome but i personally didn t get much from the story though siddhartha the character does make points i agree with for example how easy it is to exchange knowledge but difficulties lie in exchanging wisdom wisdom isn t something taught it s something you experience to apply in other situations the prose is apparently lyrical according to the internet so it reads easy i was originally going to say it reads like the copy of gilgamesh my teacher gave me in the tenth grade i figure though i could use more precise language siddhartha also exposed me to new words like castigation and motley now i know the meaning behind the band name which is awesome but now i have to decide how to convey my feelings on the book to him without upsetting him i appreciate him loaning me the book but it s just not my flavor i didn t find it interesting most events in the book seemed predictable as if the protagonist was perfectly oblivious but maybe that was the point i m not sure i ve seen posts on siddhartha before but i wanted to craft my own if you guys have any thoughts to share on the book that d be greatly appreciated maybe one of the comments will help me more to understand and further appreciate the story,1,0.94,0.06,0.94,0.06000000000000005
is it the responsibility of the person who runs the book club to ensure we avoid triggers for book club members i just started a new book club with a local hobby group none of us have met in person yet we are set to meet next month and i picked the book smoke gets in your eyes someone in the group mentioned this book will not be good for anyone who has recently lost someone i believe the person who mentioned it is a widow although not recently a week later someone mentioned they ve recently had a miscarriage and aren t sure if they should skip this book or join i want to be mindful of this as we pick future books but also wondering how much responsibility lies with the person who picks the book each time it will rotate and how much responsibility lies with the people who may be triggered by certain topics interested to hear your thoughts i picked this book because it was available as a book club kit from the local library and it sounded interesting it didn t occur to me that some people may be sensitive to this topic although i personally am okay reading any book so i don t really have triggering topics,1,0.79,0.21,0.79,0.20999999999999996

in the west can modern books today be controversial seems like a silly a question with an obvious yes answer but i can t remember seeing boycotts of fiction books becuase of the content the best i can remember was harry potter and that was from a minute group who thought it was satanic i feel like today books can be just about anything having a gay character as your lead is no longer a big deal actually i just remembered funny enough it was when jk rowling book about a cross dressing serial killer sparked controversy so there is one type of controversy but it seems rare which is surprising since artists tend to want to push their creativity to the limits which often means challenging the social norm so where is that today,1,0.92,0.08,0.92,0.07999999999999996

has anyone read guestbook ghost stories by leanne shapton i bought it because i adored the hidden title and was interested by the description but the book itself feels like it was written by an alzheimers patient it s a series of short stories and the majority of them make no sense one is a collection of photos from a party one is a list of chapter titles one is a series of photos that have been liked i just read one that had random descriptions of incidents that occurred in the titanic s restaurant there s only or stories that are identifiable as ghost stories and make sense but they re all accompanied with these ridiculous pictures that are very distracting i feel like i m missing the point i ve tried googling but the book is fairly new so there s not much information on how it s supposed to be read or what some of the stories mean if anyone s read this let me know your thoughts,1,0.93,0.07,0.93,0.06999999999999995

the great gatsby spoilers i feel that the book reflects the pursuit of the american dream and the consequent monotony that surrounds it once one is achieved all of the characters minus nick the narrator find themselves in the higher classes all indulge in fine cars fine parties servants and great houses the book mainly resolves around gatsby nick s notorious neighbour gatsby is known for his parties and the celebrities that are known to attend his premises on the daily it is later found out that gatsby lives this lifestyle to edge himself closer to his long lost love daisy gatsby has known daisy for a long time and before he went out to war was in a relationship with her once he went out to war the bond fizzled away and daisy found comfort in the hands of a different man tom buchanan a well off rich man this allowed daisy to stay within the higher classes and remain in the position she feels she belongs in a position she would risk losing should she have waited on gatsby to come back after the war who would have to start from the bottom to build his position in the country going back to the point in the beginning of the last paragraph gatsby following his fortunes would flaunt his wealth with his great house and his lavish parties by doing so he wanted to get daisy s attention and highlight his success hoping this would sway her towards him again with the help of nick who has known daisy for years he is able to invite her to nick s house having the opportunity right on his plate he consequently invites the rest of the party over to his house to further showcase his success and provide more reasons for daisy to leave tom for him despite daisy professing her love for gatsby she never completely decides to leave her husband it could be said that her husband provides her with the stability and security that she has always prioritised even though her marriage could be loveless and full of lies tangibly it serves her well and all of her materialistic needs are met despite gatsby similarly being well off financially she possibly deems him as someone desperate and even stating oh you want too much i feel that entering such relationship would put too much pressure on her to love the pressure she does not have to experience with her husband tom who does not expect any real affection and instead expects her to look well in front of others and her being his trophy wife albeit the commitment that gatsby expects daisy to take on including expressing the fact she never loved her husband was always going to prove challenging for daisy the one aspect that has never been accounted for in the novel is the buchanan child with gatsby wanting to return everything to how it was at the start of their adventure he has never really accounted for the creation of daisy and tom their child what would be his attitude to looking after a child whose father is the ex husband of the love of his life,1,0.48,0.52,0.48,0.52
how common is it not to care about plot and characters so i ve been falling the video essay rabbit hole and the most common takeaway i keep seeing is characters and basic plot structure are what really matters now admittedly most of these are about pop culture and mainstream wide audience products but i m still left with the feeling that i m the outlier i just don t care about fictional characters i can like them in superficial ways if they re funny or have cool things about them but i just can t get attached to them the way these writers and essayists seem to think everyone does same with fictional plots i can enjoy the pace and appreciate the ride but fictional stories just don t stick with me i think a big reason for me is that i read a fair bit of history and i find those historical figures far more engaging because they re real and i know i could read a hundred more books about them and every incidental figure in their story then you can play the meta game of working out which of the books is telling the truth reading allison weir has really exposed how many song of ice and fire characters are adopted from history something g r r martin a keen amateur historian has been very open about likewise these historical stories are far more engaging because of their continuity like every event and figure can be traced to one another increasingly i find i read fiction for the prose with miller s circe being my favourite fiction of the past couple years or the ideas like with the hard sci fi of greg egan the stories i enjoy being the most outlandish stuff that is usually likened to narcotics such as john clute s appleseed or the oz books i guess my question is how common is this,1,0.93,0.07,0.93,0.06999999999999995

neighbor correcting my kids too much i have a neighbor with kids the same ages as mine and my kids will sometimes play outside with theirs in the lawn this is always with both sets of parents present however basically every time we re together the father of the family will correct my children while i am already doing so or even correct me related to the situation real life example from last week my kids start playing with a squishy ball sort of close to a parked car i immediately go over and tell them they have to move back to the lawn or give up the ball he comes over and says the same thing to them i say yep i mean it s a squishy ball but i totally agree it s better they get some distance from the car he says in a really condescending tone well doesn t really matter if it s squishy though does it it s all around just a bad idea to get in the habit of throwing things near glass windows and i say yep agreed and he doubles down with i mean you wouldn t want them to harm someone s car right c mon kids you should know better i want to emphasize it s not like my kids run wild and he s fed up it s been like this since the day we met i have tried to avoid them but they re right next door so inevitably we re outside at the same time i wish it didn t bother me but this example is a week old and i am still really peeved about it i don t know if i am soliciting advice or empathy or what but i hope discussing it here will help with my pent up frustration,0,0.07,0.93,0.07,0.07

reading euphoria by lily king and andy is melting my heart i am just a few pages into the book and i am absolutely stirred by the gloom and despair andrew bankson carries inside himself your heart simply goes out for him not in a pitiful manner but where you see the words squeezing through your own vessels developing into defined thoughts in his brain his prompt action abetting to his i need you that he begs to constrain within himself the locals warping his suicide with their long stout limbs and a swarm of laughter everything is so beautiful i last read writers and lovers by lily king and thus i have high expectations from this book to not turn out dull and tedious after the first charming pages,1,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

support fathers rights false claims of domestic violence child abuse and child rape this has been my life for years as i fight for my sons rights to have a relationship with his father domestic violence claims chilean divorce it started in september when my ex wife decided to activate her legal plan by going through with her multi year threats of divorce by following the traditional chilean practice of false domestic abuse accusations you see there was domestic violence monthly but i was the recipient it s rarely spoken of with men when we are victims because we feel we need to hide it out of gender bias shame i would speak to her parents about it routinely sought help with a therapist to learn how to deal with it other than walking away i made the mistake in spain when reporting her to the police not to leave her when the sant cugat police told me there was nothing they could do as she had diplomatic immunity my us embassy said the same by not leaving the marriage then it shifted the jurisdiction to chile divorce did not exist in chile until i repeat there were no divorces in chile until just years before my marriage ended so the way to end marriages in chile until fully recommended and practiced by chilean lawyers was for the wife to falsely accuse the husband of domestic violence this was how a marriage was ended in chile lawyers practicing law prior to the law change still adhere to this practice this is not a conspiracy theory nor speculation this is fact so on september a day after being violently attacked by my ex wife resulting in multiple bloody tears to the back of my neck and her biting a large piece of my lip off she told me to pack all of my belongings and leave her home immediately as i packed a bag for malia and i to goto a hotel for the night all while on the phone with her father a doctor who is fully aware of her borderline personality disorder history of violence towards me and her history of no less than suicide attempts she called the police telling me she wants me out of the apartment she hit me spit at me told me she was going to ruin me the police arrived and kept using the word victima i corrected them and said estoy el victimo meaning male and that i was the victim as i was alone in the living room with the police my ex left the room for minutes she returned and had clearly hurt herself in the bathroom while alone i saw bruises on her face she went all in with her lies this is how chilean divorce happens i spent a night in a chilean prison then handcuffed and locked to a transport van the next day with other violent criminals and transported for arraignment in the city court house filled with thousands of other arrestees it was a nightmare my spanish was good enough with the court ordered public lawyer to make it clear i was not guilty and wouldn t accept any deal that involved me falsely claiming guilt when i was not only innocent but also the victim even worse this is how chilean mothers ensure they get custody of the children the moment i was falsely arrested she got full custody mothers in chile have a collective custody rate of children again this is not an exaggeration it is a fact and in cases when the father is a foreigner they have custody joint custody is not legal in chile you read they correctly one parent has custody the other gets visits mothers have of custody fathers have no rights fathers just pay child support and are at the mercy of the mother regarding visits as the courts don t enforce the visits because as you would guess if the mother has custody she cannot be arrested for violating a legal visit agreement because you re following it correctly the child would have no custodial guardian if the mother were in jail note that the amount i pay in child support is equal to month of my ex s salary as you probably would imagine since all of the evidence of domestic violence with the court including voice recordings i had of my ex that psychologists had listened to where she admitted to the routine violence episodes the court case was dismissed against me i won so that brings us to the role of child abuse in the legal system in chile it took me months of legal pressure just to get to see alexander at my lawyers recommendation she said to take what i can get to rebuild the relationship with alexander starting may this meant visits per week for hours each at a kids cafe or a park with his nanny present alexander and i have a great relationship and have fun regardless i even had an invitation from my ex to alexander s school for a september dance recital to celebrate september th chileans national holiday but in august my ex decided to take a trip the north of chile with alexander without my consent i went to pick him up for the visit and he wasn t there i told my lawyers and they reported it my ex took great offense to this so on september i waited for her at alexander s school saving her a seat so that alexander would see his parents together in the audience in a fit when she arrived she called the police and said i wasn t allowed to be there note that i was only there i only knew about the event because my ex invited me i couldn t risk another false arrest so i left and didn t see alexander s dance the next day i had a visit with alexander at the kids cafe at one point he was misbehaving and licking his fingers and sticking them into all of the sugar jars i kept asking him not to and explained that it was not acceptable behavior i was being a parent or at least what you d expect from an american parent i took his hand out of the jar and told him he needed to stop that he was behaving badly the nanny not an english speaker only understood the word bad and said in spanish that in chile you can t tell children that they are bad she said she was ending the visit early and taking alexander home so what did my ex do she refused to let me see alexander again always her goal and accused me of child abuse she went as far as to either hurt alexander on his back or claim that there were bruises on his back that came from me meanwhile alexander only claimed the truth that i removed his hand from the sugar so after about hours worth of visits in year i was not seeing alexander again fast forward to february and in court my ex and i agreed to a visitation schedule and plan to escalate over time to alexander sleeping over it was not a good deal it was a bad deal in fact because i had to agree to a guarantor or babysitter being present for the first stage but again my lawyer said that after not seeing alexander for months and barely seeing him in that i should focus on building the relationship with him the guarantor was supposed to last for only month starting in march it s now august march came and the visits started then after weeks i went to pick him up and he was not there there was no answer at the apartment turns out my ex had moved to arica chile miles away my lawyers fought to force her to return with alexander but the court wouldn t budge because of the pandemic so in june i flew to arica and moved there at first it was as if my ex had a moment of clarity and realized how important a relationship with a father is to a young boy she brought him to my apartment at the beach each day i cooked for him and her each day we celebrated malia dog s birthday on june he was so happy but then the demon appeared again from my ex the overbearing smothering mother who forced my son to wear a winter jacket on the beach while other kids his age were swimming in the ocean she stopped bringing him over and with a quarantine it was impossible to find a guarantor there it was illegal to leave the home and there are checkpoints everywhere i had permission from the court to pick up alexander from his grandparents but there was no permission for a guarantor to work after months of not seeing alexander i found someone willing to take the risk and i got to see alexander x per week in august in september we all returned to santiago and the visits went well november came and i even invited my ex for thanksgiving so that alexander could have a family holiday christmas came then new years then alexander s birthday on january my ex would not allow me to be with alexander for his family party instead he and i had to celebrate at my place but we were together at least during this time starting in september the court ordered family therapy from feb finally started it was difficult as my ex did not use this as an opportunity for growth but to still go all in on her strategy of lies the role of the therapist was to deem me fine as a parent to no longer need a guarantor and for alexander to start weekend sleepovers on thursday march th the family therapist contacted me directly and said she was going to write her report that weekend to skip phase no guarantor and go directly to phase alexander sleeping over an hour later we did the session with my ex and the therapist shared this news with my ex my ex responded by saying she would do everything in her power to block it i had my visit on march th and it was a great visit but later that day my ex reached out to the family therapist and accused me of raping alexander note that there is a guarantor present during the visits at all times so what my ex did was not only make a horrendous claim against me as a father but besmirch the professionalism of the university certified guarantor by claiming she was involved as expected due to these false claims the family therapist needed to excuse herself from the case her recommendation spoken but not yet written was never submitted to the court even though the courts continue to tell my ex that she has to permit the visits and the agreed phone calls she refuses again because the courts won t arrest her as she has custody and they can t arrest her if it means alexander would have nobody this is my reality i haven t seen alexander since march i m haven t spoken to him since early july and the calls are pointless as my ex will only allow the calls when she s playing with him or he s watching tv she permits me to be an observer only these past years what i am going through is a reality for many fathers please hold your children tightly show them love and for those of you reading this who are divorced please please do what is best for your child a child needs the love from both of their parents going out of your way to hurt the person you married and failed with as a couple only harms the child don t hurt your children love them encourage them to have strong bonds with the other parent that is something we all signed up for as parents to put our children first so please support fathers rights,0,0.13,0.87,0.13,0.13

weird thumb sucking noise after sleep training my son was not a thumb sucker before we sleep trained him at months old but it s something he started immediately after being trained before he falls asleep when he wakes up randomly in the middle of the night and when he wakes up in the morning he sucks his thumb to comfort himself and is usually able to fall back asleep my question is about the noise he makes while sucking his thumb the best way to describe the noise is by trying to inhale from the back of your throat so it produces an inward hum along with the inhale it s like a gasp of air with an audible tone he drags the inhale does it on the exhale as well and repeats it for every breath has anyone else experienced this and figured out a way to get their babe to stop or reduce the loudness it can be heard in the entire home just to be clear he has no problems breathing and our paediatrician said the sound is just vocal discovery but she wasn t helpful in regards to the sleep training aspect we had hoped it would disappear by now but he has been doing this for months it s frustrating because while he sucks his thumb as a soothing method the noise wakes up the rest of the house,0,0.07,0.93,0.07,0.07

gai jin james clavell so i ve started reading though the asian saga by james clavell and it s incredible i m just about done with the rd book in the series gai jin and i have to put my opinion out there about it a lot of reviews i ve seen about it say that it isn t a good book or at least is the worst of the asian saga i have been really enjoying the book at least as much as the previous it seems people are turned off by the characters and their specific decisions that they make but to me the characters seem to be the most realistic so far in the series they are all conflicted and make bad decisions and the narrative supports them and explains their reason for doing so personally i think that a person being too stoned and horny to make good decisions to be the most realistic narrative i ve read in a long time i will say that angelique is an annoying character but the way the story is set up who can really blame her for being dishonest she lives in a time where being raped is her fault and she s only acting in her best interests in conclusion as far as realistic characters and their personal decisions go i think gai jin captures this really well p s i love you,1,0.98,0.02,0.98,0.020000000000000018

how do i avoid favoritism with my children i m posting this on a throwaway account i f had my oldest child f when i was nineteen years old her father isn t in the picture at all and she was diagnosed with high functioning autism she is pretty much the apple of my eye she is sweet funny incredibly bright and super talented she is pretty much the best daughter that anyone could ask for and doesn t really give me any issues despite typical seven year old behavior and the meltdowns and quirks associated with autism when i married my husband m he immediately wanted a child i did not want another child until my oldest was older and more independent and had been taking birth control my husband unfortunately tampered with my birth control and i got pregnant with my youngest child f after my youngest was born i went through postpartum depression and since i love her but i ve had a bit of resentment towards her after having ppd my resentment of my youngest had gotten worse over the years because a she s quite stubborn and insolent towards me and b she s mean and bullies my oldest breaking my oldest s toys hitting kicking my oldest name calling etc this resentment toward my youngest has coupled with the fact the my oldest has special needs and needs my attention more has resulted in perceived favoritism towards my oldest because my youngest is a daddy s girl and he is completely smitten with her my husband and i have been getting into arguments about this perceived favoritism he feels like i m not attentive enough with my youngest and he says that he refuses to let my youngest feel unloved and slip through the cracks so as a result i feel like my husband overcompensates and spoils her and allows her to get away with a lot how can i fix this favoritism,0,0.01,0.99,0.01,0.01
blown away by the dark forest by cixin liu three body problem was excellent but it feels a little like a prequel in hindsight anyways i just wanted to share that having just finished the dark forest last night i am reeling right now because i think it s the best thing i ve ever read and i just wanted to share this somewhere sure it s sci fi but it goes so far beyond that i guess i don t want to ramble too long here but if you want to read something that will absolutely blow your mind amp give you hope for the future i want to give this my absolute highest recommendation just know that you will probably still want to start with three body problem think of three body as a necessary prequel which lays the groundwork for the extra crazy stuff later on also three body problem has its own share of crazy stuff but the writing quality in the dark forest is somehow exponentially better has anyone else read this any other thoughts on it i realize it s less about the characters than the ideas and so could see how somebody could fall off part way through but i simply wanted to say the pay off is magnificent,1,0.9,0.1,0.9,0.09999999999999998

how important to you is your kid s age when searching for a new activity hey guys i was wondering how do you find activities that you are doing with your kids and how important is it for you to be sure that they are age appropriate i m a mom of a yo boy and i ve been searching for meaningful activities to do with him since he was born internet is filled with amazing arts and crafts and i ve done tons of them with him but the longer i m in the topic the more i feel i overwhelmed him with most of those a lot of the things i made for him simply weren t appropriate for his age the ones that were simple i didn t know how to turn into an engaging play so they were boring the other ones were way too demanding which resulted in him slowly starting to ask me to do everything instead of him i ve developed this frustration around a thought that our together play might be negatively affecting his confidence and independence i started writing down and planning activities trying to learn as much about how it affects development and how to do it correctly spent most of my time on montessori and rie materials am i overthinking it or is this a thing that we all go through how do you go about finding activities for your children,0,0.16,0.84,0.16,0.16

r scott bakker s the darkness that comes before is one of my favorite books ever i don t know how many here have read it so i might just be speaking into void but by golly is it good the review that sold me on it basically described it as nietzsche meets tolkien which was absolutely weird enough for me to give it a go the first read through i was overwhelmed by how brutal it was not it s combat of which there s actually very little but it s plain honesty about why people do the things they do from the high to the low the kind to the cruel benevolent or monstrous which is kind of the point of the novel the nietzsche part some truly nasty things happen in the book or are implied which can be worse in a way i put it down and didn t touch it again for a year but always it s lingered in the back of my mind the ideas within are compelling so i picked it up again recently on a whim and the tolkien part shined through this time the worldbuilding is immense unapologetically so and i could appreciate it s grandeur better on the second reading and i m now primed and ready to read the rest of the series the problem is that i want to recommend it to others but there s one thing in particular that holds me back the treatment of women in the book is absolutely brutal i wondered whether this was something worming into the text from the author s heart but i think on the second pass it is simply the world he created a medieval world just barely crawling out of ancient past bloody and battered patriarchal society with all the brutality implied the two female characters given ample screentime are well written struggling with their inner turmoil like everyone else with little help from the world they inhabit gross things happen to them they do gross things but every damn character in that book is a facet of the larger point embodied by the man who seems both a protagonist and a villain everyone everyone is tossed in the currents of what everyone around them thinks of them their very psyches wrestle with the fact the schoolman is a tottering fool the prostitute and the concubine are worthless harlots the barbarian is rejected by his warlike people no mattet how great his fighting prowess even the emperor and his court are unsure of their positions their ploys their power i m rambling now the point is there s a lot to love and think about here if one can get past some of the more brutal language and themes not to mention that the prose itself is gripping if sometimes heavy on exposition would you all recommend the book to others how would you go about it tldr the book is awesome but full of misogyny among other brutal things worth recommending how to do so,1,0.92,0.08,0.92,0.07999999999999996

my kid the biter being urged to consider other daycares my son just turned last month he also just started a new daycare last month about two weeks ago i was told that he has been biting a kid in class so i try talking to him about biting we read books about hitting and i remix it to add things about not biting one week ago i was give an incident report to sign he bit the kid again owner comes out and says he really needs to stop biting or else he is simply not a good fit for us again i work with him at home about his biting today i was told he bit the kid again bit another kid and broke the skin or something like that hit a kid while they were napping and tried to bite his teacher so i was told i needed to pick him up when i get there owner basically says he cannot come back for to weeks because parent of child came to the school and was yelling and cussing and threatening to sue demanded to talk to my son and myself threatened to call dcf on me according to the owner owner also basically said i could bring him back tomorrow but we don t know what is going to happen wth does that mean she also said i should look for another daycare to be a better fit for my son giving me recommendations while at the same time saying he can come back in weeks my son loves his school they keep him busy and happy idk why he has been biting i strongly feel it is because of other students doing something to him at home we live with other children and under he bites in self defense or over excitement i am sorry about the kids he is biting but i know it s a phase and it will pass should i be looking for another daycare i don t really like how they handled the whole situation basically saying my child isn t welcome because another parent came to the school and threw a temper tantrum i have tried my best to help him stop biting but obviously this won t phase out in weeks i work full time and i am so extremely stressed out at the thought of having to start my daycare search over and go through the whole transition process again with him it is so hard on parent and child having to leave them with strangers as they cry out for you it s terrible i get daily reports sent to my phone and they always say his mood is cheerful i d also like to mention there are cameras in the rooms should i request to see them to make sure no other child is hitting him or something of the sort if your child was being bit at school what would you like to see happen what do you expect toddler go through phases where they bite should parents be expected to switch schools because their toddler is biting as if that will change anything it might even make the biting issue worse i don t know what to do i feel sick and stressed out and overwhelmed,0,0.07,0.93,0.07,0.07

what is the most haunting book you ve read i m currently reading lord of the flies for the first time and i have to say some of the imagery created and circumstances that have been described are quite haunting in comparison to books i ve read previously there was one part where nothing significant happened but one of the boys was playfully throwing stones at another who was sitting on the beach william golding goes on to say how he is acting on laws created by a civilisation they thought to be destroyed he could easily hit the boy with the rock but now even without laws in place and without adult supervision he still purposefully misses i guess me writing it out here doesn t convey what i m trying to say but regardless the book still has some obvious sections that are disturbing to think about also not haunting as in scary more like food for thought the kind that makes you wonder and deeply disturbs you if that makes sense,1,0.89,0.11,0.89,0.10999999999999999

margaret cavendish the blazing world and other writings so i ve been playing a video game called civilization if you know you know won t get into detail since it s a book sub other than it s a game based off ancient history from antiquity to modern age and i took notes of the great people and works of art margaret cavendish came up and her story called the blazing world the in game description peaked my interest and i ordered it on amazon ended up getting several stories along with the one originally of interest reading through the contract now a few pages in and already it s super neat it s interesting how such a young girl in the story could be so wise as to address her distraught uncle in the way she does how being taught such major philosophies and morals could make a child distinguish the actuality from the absolute despite the elitist education she maintains individuality and maturity the daughter being married off by her uncle to his dying friend s son whom is a prosperous duke her at the age of to a much older man the duke s son by the dying duke s bedside and officially witnessed time passes and she recognized that the husband didn t much care for her from the beginning there was no malice it was simply a non acknowledgement the duke s son had protested initially as she was just a child but agreed to satisfy his dying father s wish non acknowledgement of something as sacred as an official marriage given the time period and it s harsh circumstances th century the duke s son married off to some older lady who he s been promised to marry upon her husband s death harsh as it felt to the uncle she now comforting her own grown ass uncle whom she of course loved as her original father passed before the marriage really strikes a fucking chord with me sort of saying who cares about some botched fake marriage you re still here with me uncle why care about someone who doesn t care about me that s some wholesome shit but speaks about some underlying truths about absurdities involving marriage ordained by god indeed i don t know enough about margaret cavendish but i d love to know more if anyone would like to offer more insight i know google exists but i like people too,1,0.46,0.54,0.46,0.54

does sapiens by noah harari say anything about airborne viruses being spread faster in different environments from your own so my friend f came to me with this statement people catch corona faster in other countries than in their own not because of going out more or being in contact with more people but purely because it s a different environment so now she says that people travelling even if they re being low key right now is stupid because covid spreads faster if you re in another environment a neighbouring family we live in the same street recently caught covid and she s convinced they caught it on vacation in spain they traveled by car and stayed in their private airbnb no restaurants or crowded places or even the beach because their son is immunocompromised so it was low risk i asked why and she said that she s reading this noah harari book which led her to this conclusion the family has been back for almost weeks now and only recently days tested positive for coronavirus here in our country they ve been to local pubs and concerts so i think it s more likely they caught it here as the average incubation period is around days i asked her for links etc but she hasn t showed any and said well i ve read about it and i told her i m not sold on the theory i know that you can get sick quicker like a cold in other environments because your body isn t used to it like it is to your usual one but i don t think it applies to an airborne and highly infectious virus like covid covid is covid and just as infectious here as it is on the other side on the planet can anyone provide me more info because i m really curious about this and personally i ve never read the book,1,0.48,0.52,0.48,0.52
obligatory project hail mary discussion thread spoilers just finished this very enjoyable read i have a couple thoughts first it absolutely amazed me how rocky and grace acted towards each other with the free sharing of information and scientific research i was stunned when grace decides to simply give rock s race essentially all of human knowledge without seemingly any consideration for the ramification of that decision to a lesser extent rocky providing the technology of xenonite there is no talk about the warlike nature of humans i understand the joint effort of solving the astrophage problem puts the two races on about as warm an opening terms as possible i can t help but think that a large portion of humanity would either not approve of or possibly even consider grace s actions a betrayal of humanity what about grace s choice to bet the entire survival of earth on his faith in the beetles i think it was the honorable choice but i can t help but wonder how observers on earth would react i wonder how much of the truth of the events was put on those hard drives do they for example have complete audio recordings of the entire scientific research with rocky given our knowledge where they live presumably abundant astrophage and concerns about the comparative strengths in engineering and access to humanity s accumulated knowledge is a warfleet incoming also am i the only one who doesn t understand how in a world where energy should be essentially freely available how the expectation of widescale starvation is a real threat like in a world where they can pave most the sahara with solar pannels powering astrophage enrichment could they not set up industrial mega farming using that freely available energy to power lamps i guess its sort of implied that it is all timing but in the wait after the launch of the ship they knew it would be at least another years at a bare minimum before a response it also rattled around in my head that weir s approach to interspecies negotiation and cooperation was about as polar opposite from cxn liu s take from three body problem could possibly bee,1,0.9,0.1,0.9,0.09999999999999998

the broken earth trilogy was really good no i don t know who they is just that my general impression had been that people generally though n k jeminsen was amazing and her books lovely of course i read the inheritance trilogy on reading similar praise but have to admit i didn t care for it as much while i completely appreciated the new perspective on fantasy something about the story never resonated with me of course i was younger than five years ago and maybe i should give it another shot in any case broken earth holy shit that was good finished the last book last night and it just was great my non spoiler take is that she crafted a world that was fascinating and like most good sci fi fantasy a reflection and commentary on our own bonus points for the nd person point of view that i initially found jarring but ultimately really liked more bonus points for a non standard fantasy protagonist and now for spoilers gt i was surprised last night that that essun s and nassun s reunion was covered in basically the last pages of the trilogy since early in book i had expected that the narrative was building to some mother daughter team up fight to save the world and while that s what we sort of got in the end usually authors spend a bit more time exploring these kinds of relationships lt gt but maybe that was the point their relationship while not irreparable would have taken at least another book to repair and certainly couldn t be fixed in the few moments between their reunion and nassun trying to turn everyone into stone eaters so essun ultimately had to fall back on her core and decide that to ensure her daughter lived she d let her daughter wipe out humanity it s an interesting character point considering what she did to cordu while her justification for that was understandable it s interesting to compare it to her justification for saving nassun which basically boils down to she s my daughter lt gt nassun herself is a fascinating character because we basically have a year old serving as the primary villain antagonist which is unusual her whole perspective has been shaped by the trauma she s had to endure and survive not unlike her mother there the world has constantly been terrible to her so ramming the moon into the earth seems like a good way to end all the terrible and later when she softens and decides she doesn t want to ram the moon into the earth but rather just wants to turn all the humans into stone eaters that s really just so that the earth will spare the one human she thinks she has left that has actually cared for her and protected her and there s the wonderful irony that nassun wants to wipe out humanity to save schaffa and essun is prepared to let her to save nassun lt as i said i just finished the last book last night and so will need to think and process some more i d be curious as to the thoughts of others who have read it,1,0.82,0.18,0.82,0.18000000000000005

american war by omar el akkad omar el akkad is a relatively new novelist in the sense of the word american war is his first novel published in followed by only one other novel this year which i have not read for those who are not familiar american war follows sarat chestnut throughout her entire life set in the backdrop of a second american civil war omar el akkad as a journalist covered the wars in the middle east and he uses that experience to craft a unique telling of this sort of scenario the war is not fought traditionally but with the seccessionist governments of georgia mississippi and alabama having an uneasy negotiation process with the u s federal government instead the war is fought between militias on both sides who slaughter entire refugee camps viciously kill prisoners all for seemingly no reason the experiences sarat is subjected to throughout the first quarter of the novel already set in a terrifyingly plausibility future scenario create a compelling narrative which forces the reader to think about what exactly the current u s social climate is the conflict in american war is seemingly devoid of real symbols no one seems to understand what the united states was no one is motivated seemingly by race sarat is hispanic nor religion or any other strong belief instead characters are motivated by either their tribe say family or friends or a propagandized view of the world that last part is my interpretation of the work it is like matt ruff s the mirage an attempt to showcase the brutality of conflicts the u s is involved in by plausbily placing that same conflict in the united states a further point of the novel is to analyse how people are propagandized into doing some of the horrific things done by sarat throughout the novel it not only looks at the brutality of war but how war is a self sustaining cycle driven by the trauma inflicted upon the young if anyone else has read the novel what are your thoughts regarding it what is your interpretation as i can definitely see others within,1,0.85,0.15,0.85,0.15000000000000002

how to explain non religious fasting to a young and sensitive child i m planning to introduce regular intermittent fasting and possibly longer hour fasts for general health purposes not for weight loss i have some autoimmune issues and have researched about how fasting may have a positive effect i mentioned it to my husband earlier today and just said off handedly do you just want to do a hour fast from now it was just after dinner so we would be fasting until the next day s dinner my year old overheard and instantly started asking questions why won t you eat breakfast or lunch tomorrow will i eat breakfast and lunch tomorrow she seemed to start getting upset and misunderstood that she wouldn t be eating lunch for some reason which culminated in a very minor bit of upset that she got over relatively quickly i tried to explain that sometimes grown ups skip breakfast or lunch because it helps their bodies heal ouchies and rest but that kids don t need to do that because they are growing every day she has had a very tenuous relationship with food since she started solids and still only eats a handful of foods reliably so i do not want to cause her any additional stress about eating or eating behaviours i definitely do not want her to start worrying about how how often she eats or start down a path of disordered eating until now we ve been super relaxed about meals with her and never forced her to eat anything she didn t like eat when she wasn t hungry i m worried that incorporating fasting into my daily routine and doing a hour fast once or twice a month might cause some kind of trauma am i overthinking any parents here who regularly fast have any insights,0,0.03,0.97,0.03,0.03

ending of and then there were none doesn t make sense to me i finished and then there were none yesterday and after reading through the epilogue the crucial point of the mystery wargrave s fake death doesn t make sense to me what i don t understand is why would armstrong think that wargrave s fake death would help them catch the murderer wargrave explains the plan like this it was then that i intimated to armstrong that we must carry our plan into effect it was simply this i must appear to be the next victim that would perhaps rattle the murderer at any rate once i was supposed to be dead i could move about the house and spy upon the unknown murderer armstrong was keen on the idea we carried it out that evening if i were armstrong i d see two options the murderer is one of the guests in this case everyone including the murderer is running up the stairs to help vera the murderer would know immediately that wargrave s death was fake because it wasn t him the murderer who killed him he d know that wargrave is trying to trick him the murderer is some external person not one of the guests in this case he d also know that wargrave was not really killed unless we assume the unlikely scenario that there are two real murderers in both scenarios wargrave doesn t have it easier to move about the house and spy upon the unknown murderer whether he faked his death or not can someone explain if i m missing something here,1,0.91,0.09,0.91,0.08999999999999997

update on suspended kindergartener my youngest was driving everyone crazy all year long the teachers kept calling emailing and requesting conferences he was openly defiant and lied to them about things he d done he annoyed others on purpose yet would punch anyone who annoyed him his grades were okay but none of them could get him to do his work or listen the principal started talking about repeating k and suggested talking to our doctor at home things weren t any better he turned in june and middle kid m are months apart and used to be really close now m was always the one who got hurt and he d cry on f s shoulder about how he doesn t want a brother anymore both of them kept begging me to send him away they started locking their bedroom doors my husband and i were exhausted from punishing him all the time nothing helped we even went to extremes like taking away all of his possessions except for clothes and books and canceling his birthday i asked his tkd instructor to belt test the other two without him it wasn t fair that they worked hard while he just stood there flailing around like an inflatable tube man the ped suggested either an adhd test at their office or a psych eval i chose the latter and we waited months for an appointment after insurance btw surprise it s adhd i was actually afraid he was a psychopath or something as the psychologist explained i started seeing the distractedness blown up all over his life teachers asking how to get him to pay attention frequent reminders to focus at tkd siblings screaming you never listen i wasn t aware that power struggles and poor impulse control are linked to adhd obviously we still expect to make good choices he s now in first grade and has a few marks for not paying attention but no punching phew we just started trying a low dose of medication i m also asking them to keep an eye on his academic level he scored on the iq test and last year he was always complaining that the worksheets were boring anyway if you re still reading thank you i wanted to put this out there in case it helps someone,0,0.36,0.64,0.36,0.36
thoughts on memoirs i know memoirs have been something of a hot trend in the publishing industry for the past decade or so but i m wondering if regular people are really into reading them for as much praise and press as the genre gets personally if i go for one it is usually by someone who has an interesting perspective on a specific topic and not so much an autobiography of a famous person explaining how they got famous richard blano s the prince of los cocuyos and william finnegan s barbarian days come to mind when i think about really well done stories about unique topics that being said i have recently read books that i fall into this genre that have left a bad taste in my mouth both of which written by well known non authors famous in other industries i think i ve figured out that i just cannot stand memoirs that mask as a story about something down to earth but ultimately pan out to be a look at how that person rose to fame always humbly of course so i guess my question is this do you read memoirs what kind do you find yourself gravitating towards and why or why don t you read them and do you feel similarly in the sense that they can be overblown personal diaries for the rich and famous,1,0.92,0.08,0.92,0.07999999999999996

supervising your children on youtube the internet i just found that my year old nephew has been waking up really scared throughout the night because he has been watching stuff he shouldn t on youtube he s been watching ghost haunting videos even though he knows he shouldn t i cannot stress enough to you parents being a horror fan and youtube enthusiast myself that you should always keep an eye on what your kids are doing online don t let them get to comfortable because as they get older they will get more curious and want to watch certain things they may think its alright and that they re tough right up until they are not also youtube kids may be for kids but even then never leave them alone with that app it is not safe and some stuff that may be inappropriate can slip through the cracks youtube is not all sunshine and rainbows the youtube algorithm will recommend anything based on what they watch and if that content happens to be spooky themed or whatnot it may recommend some inappropriate stuff i m not saying to monitor their every move you gotta still let them somewhat be in control so they can grow and feel trusted but never leave them alone whilst watching something if your kids want something scary i suggest you read them some goosebumps books or darren shan if they re a little older but never let them browse that sort of stuff freely or it cold lead to late nights for you and nightmares for them,0,0.21,0.79,0.21,0.21

baby nursery theme different culture ok so first off i am a happily married for years f white mama we have a y daughter but have been trying for a second child for nearly years now we ve already gotten the nursery mostly done as i personally did not want to be putting major main nursery furniture or decor together while pregnant now when we started putting it together there wasn t any or as much i guess of the black lives matter movement or culture appropriation stuff please don t take my wording to heart or wrong way i m terrible at wording what i actually mean so our nursery theme is safari but more specifically zimbabwe it looks to average person as safari with some animal stone plates in african art type style i really love the art style but i m honestly wondering if this is wrong or offensive i m or grade i did a whole presentation on zimbabwe and the culture i went deep into it the research as i found it so beautiful and fascinating took class periods on separate days just to do the presentation because i had so much to present while others just did a poster and paper on their culture of random draw i know i probably shouldn t put the zimbabwe flag up on the nursery wall but still want to incorporate the bright colors in some way i also found a gorgeous stone plate hangs on the wall that has a dancing woman on it beautifully done and says was made in zimbabwe so even better to me double points on that but i also found beautiful woven baskets made in zimbabwe as well would any of these be ok or would it be seen negatively offensively my best girlfriend who is a person of color says she sees no issue with it and her mother who is african thinks it s wonderful i m doing this but i m still concerned it could be offensive if not offensive does anyone have other beautifully done decor suggestions from zimbabwe,0,0.34,0.66,0.34,0.34

so scared of childcare i wonder if any other abuse survivors feel apprehensive and scared of placing their child in daycare i don t feel i can trust almost anyone to care for my son he is months old and has only ever been cared for by my husband and i the only people i can imagine leaving him with are his dad and my sister i think i could trust my mother in law if she was in my house even that scares me it s not that i think she would hurt him as much as i fear if someone else were around somehow something could happen and it doesn t matter anyway because these people all live in different cities i m considering going back to work and i ll need to place him in daycare and the thought makes me so uncomfortable i know firsthand how well meaning caregivers can fail to protect children when not vigilant and i know how seemingly safe situations individuals can be sinister or damaging unbeknownst to the parents i lived it i want to protect my child this is on top of more usual concerns like fear of missing out on him growing up while he spends so much time at day care just wondering if there are other abuse survivors with experience on this,0,0.08,0.92,0.08,0.08
what s an acclaimed book you personally couldn t stand for me personally it s gentleman in moscow admittedly going in i knew i had no interest in older world history based stories i know little of foreign politics or the wars and just generally don t care about this time period but i figured it s fiction and it s acclaimed so i could do it when i got into it i immediately couldn t believe the premise the story of a man being held prisoner in a closet sized room of a hotel makes zero sense so it was hard for me to accept it as reality beyond that it drove me up the wall that they refused to call him his name and instead referred to him as the count i don t know what a count is but its a ridiculous title for anyone and gave me flashbacks to a series of unfortunate events worse than that was how frequently the author used his name in a single paragraph the words the count appeared as many as times this isn t normal any other book with this sentence structure would be ridiculed the count went to the store the count realized upon entering that the count had forgotten his wallet when the count returned to his hotel room he was greeted by his barber upon seeing the count the barber inquired about the puzzled look on his face it came off so nauseating and pretentious anyone else have any titles seemingly everyone loved that you hated,1,0.84,0.16,0.84,0.16000000000000003

what type of kid can benefit from montessori daycare preschool my son just past his rd birthday had been in daycare from early on but then had to stop when the daycare shut down due to the pandemic we resumed earlier this year after almost months without going to daycare my son was put into a new class appropriate for his age and with a new teacher his new teacher is more studious than the pre pandemic teacher we had before much of their activities involve them sitting at the table for painting puzzles learning alphabets and listening to the teacher reading books out loud this is quite different than what he was used to with his pre pandemic teacher who did a lot more physical activities dancing running and pretend plays he was very well adapted and active pre pandemic now with his new teacher he hates going to daycare so much and refuses to speak at school to the point where the teacher was concerned about his development this was interesting because other teachers who interact with him sub support teachers the director etc said the complete opposite saying that he is quite chatty with them on that last point we did want to make sure and saw a speech therapist who said that he is slightly behind in his receptive and expressive language on the cusp of what would be the normal range but not accompanied by other issues such as aggressive behaviors sociability learning etc she thinks being cooped up during the pandemic and him growing up in a bilingual household may have contributed to the delay we ve been working on his language and he has improved quite a bit already he can communicate his needs can ask for help can follow simple orders and step orders can sing along can pretend play and knows alphabets numbers colors animals etc he can form word sentences and is very aware of his surroundings he is very social within the family can take an hour or so to warm up to other kids but usually behaves well enough amp x b now we want to leave the current daycare because they have no other class options it s a small daycare and i think our son could benefit from a different style of care but the only other decent options in our neighborhood are two montessori schools neither my husband nor i have any personal experience with montessori programs so we have nothing to go on our son loves the outdoors and doing physical activities but is good at following teachers instructions i d say he is independent enough but i think he does well with guided stimulations when encountering new books new games or new places amp x b so my questions are what is it like what do kids actually do on day to day basis what kind of kids do well in montessori would our son s speech delay be a big problem in a montessori if any of you moved from a non montessori to a montessori school what was the transition like amp x b thanks all,0,0.16,0.84,0.16,0.16

just finished reading my first agatha christie novel ever am i late to the club hell i don t know where else to hype about this i ve been reading books for years now and why didn t i ever pick an agatha christie novel makes me wonder about my reading choices you are telling me this masterpiece was around the whole time and i just chose not to read it the book i finished is death on the nile i can t even begin to explain why i loved it too much usually when a writer is so famous or a novel is so famous you start thinking that the actual books don t rise up to the hype i found it beautiful how a detective story could hold this much exquisite expressions the description you could hear the gun fire you could feel the boat on the sea and i guess i am finally part of the fan club it is indeed well deserved if anyone care to recommend her best works to me i ll be thankful,1,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
on the road yet another rereading hi all this is yet another on the road rereading by an old hag who tried to rediscover my youth by rereading old novels that had a profound effect on me when i was much younger it seems that on the road is a popular novel to reread so i decided to try my hand at finding new things that i didn t catch through my first reading and i have to say my second time revisiting it more than a decade later made me hate almost everything let s begin d this rereading made me see the characters plot lines and themes in a different perspective which left me feeling quite hollow and empty until the ending when our protagonist meets his future wife throughout the novel there were moments when i remember screaming in my head are you kidding me and the more popular why are you like this these questions of course was mainly directed to our comedy duo sal and dean i can understand why teenage me was enamored with this book the traveling new experiences and the promise of adventure but all i saw when i reread this book was a horrifyingly bleak future that awaits both sal and dean sal poor delusional sal he s become somewhat codependent on dean and nowhere is this more apparent when he opens his mouth to defend dean against galatea my homegirl laying down some truth bombs about his irresponsibility and inconsiderate way of life there s just something so tragic about seeing a toxic relationship whether platonic or romantic consume someone so completely that they re willing to defend the abuser this one scene really stuck out to me and serves as one of the pivots points in sal s character development dean just ditched marylou and sal in san francisco as he drives off to see camille amp x b gt we had to eat and didn t do so till midnight when we found a nightclub singer in her hotel room who turned an iron upside down on a coat hanger in the wastebasket and warmed up a can of pork and beans i looked out the window at the winking neons and said to myself where is dean and why isn t he concerned about our welfare this image really stuck with me it shows how incredibly wrong sal was concerning his friendship with dean he was willing to go to the ends of the earth with dean and defend him against anyone who spoke poorly of him yet here he is ditched on the side of the street with no money and no where to go starving in the middle of a strange city eating a can of beans heated on a hot iron in the hotel room of a stranger rereading experience was great but maturity absolutely changes the experience on to kerouac s next novel big sur,1,0.75,0.25,0.75,0.25

the history of the decline and fall of the roman empire by edward gibbon i have the privilege of being able to listen to audiobooks for long stretches of the work day that is the only way i could actually finish the entire thing and to be fair a lot of it went in one ear and out the other the audio connesuer recording that i have on audible is hours long and is narrated by charlton griffin who is excellent it is the longest book i have ever read by a huge margin i m still trying to wrap my mind around some of the chapters but if i had to do the whole thing the disservice of categorizing it in a sentence i would call it a thorough history of the european dark ages and the formation of the catholic church the wild thing to me is that gibbon wrote it in the late th century and it is completely irreverent in regards to christianity he never misses an opportunity to point out the absurd self interest and hypocrisy of the ecclesiastical order i would catch myself grinning at the wry humor of the author combined with charlton griffin s on point delivery i want to recommend this humongous set of volumes to anybody that has an interest in a challenging historical read it s not as boring as it sounds i genuinely feel enriched by what little i could take away from my listening experience and i would love to hear other readers thoughts or recommendations thank you,1,0.91,0.09,0.91,0.08999999999999997

east of eden cathy s last scene made me sad i ve been thinking about cathy from john steinbeck s east of eden i read iyear ago i wanted to express this cathy s last chapter where she commits suicide in her grey room is extremely sad haunting and dare i say bleakest death in the novel right there w tom hamilton s i know that she s written as an antagonist and the most destructive figure in the story but i feel like calling her pure evil downgrades the complexity and depth her character carries steinbeck tried really hard to make her portrayal cartoonish at times but despite this the parts where we study her logic and thoughts could be an impressive realistic portryal of someone who displays negative traits of aspd antisocial personality disorder in real life the language in which her death is written just radiates bleak hopeless energy it s as if her character becomes a lost cause destructive force w inability to empathize yet there are several parts in the book where she either breaks down crying or displays certain emotions of admiration towards her children that she didn t want in the first place i see her in a sympathetic light she was manipulative sadistic and harmful towards everyone yet such a broken human being she couldn t see any good in anyone and at one point when she gets called out by adam about this she becomes angry and cries realizing she lacks something fundamental as a living being another thing she is a very well written character in a way that we get to explore her mind in specific instances on a deep almost uncomfortably private level how her logic works and how she sees people as things to use rather than just living creatures to interact with i also think something about her remembering all the faces of important people she met including samuel right in her last minute is deeply vulnerable and raw last thing she thinks of are people who she either tried to ruin or who tried to care for her it s not her mother or her father it s samuel and adam and cal and charles and that just breaks me a little i can t really verbalize why this touches me so much it just does certain aspects of her character resonates w me strongly for some reason i ve also read steinbeck s journal of a novel couple months later in which he wrote small introspective notes about chapters of east of eden right before actually writing them it s kind of surprising that he writes i didn t tell you that i got up at four this morning to work on this final cathy scene but i did couldn t sleep for thinking about it and i couldn t see any reason to lie in bed waiting for daylight i guess there will be a howl that i am being sympathetic to her i m not really just putting it down as it might have happened there aren t any should have beens this is the way cathy died he didn t really sympathize w her character but she still has a sympathetic side to read does anyone remember her last scene as vividly as i do,1,0.57,0.43,0.57,0.43000000000000005

the very first book about the palestinian israel situation that was written by a palestinian book name mornings in jenin after reading this novel i felt grateful for the fact that i live in a country where we wouldn t have to live in uncertainty all the time about someone blowing our house with a bomb while we are asleep how does one live in a world that turns away from injustice for so long toughness found fertile soil in the hearts of palestinians and the grains of resistance embedded themselves in their skin endurance evolved as a hallmark of refugee society but the price they paid was the subduing of tender vulnerability they learned to celebrate martyrdom only martyrdom offered freedom only in death were they at last invulnerable to israel martyrdom became the ultimate defiance of israeli occupation thank you i answered unsure of the proper american response to her gracious enthusiasm in the arab world gratitude is a language unto itself may allah bless the hands that give me this gift beauty is in the eyes that find me pretty may allah never deny your prayer and so on an infinite string of prayerful appreciation coming from such a culture i have always found a mere thank you an insufficient expression that makes my voice sound miserly and ungrateful mornings in jenin follows the story of the family named abulheja and how generations of that family lead their lives after getting thrown from their ancient village called ein hod to a refugee camp in jenin through their eyes we get to see how the fate of palestinians and their lives turn upside down the story starts to unfold from the very second world war days and ends after the jenin massacre the massacre that never got covered by the mainstream media the very injustice that the world decided to ignore i have always admired how some writers could write stories about individuals whose life traversed generation after generation so exquisitely and let me tell you susan abulhawa is one of those writers whose vocabulary choices and sentence building is going to give you goosebumps while i was reading the book it felt as if i was witnessing the things palestinians were witnessing honestly kudos to susan abulhawa for the brilliant prose no matter how many videos documentaries we see about the lives of these displaced palestinians nothing can touch the heart in a way this book touched my heart it educated my brain about the significant decisions incidents that took place in palestine while it touched and scattered my heart by making me witness the brutality palestinians had to endure for all these years this book made me realize how heartbreaking it is to be thrown out of my own land and how beautiful the feeling of martyrdom can be this is the first historical fiction book written by a palestinian who truly witnessed the pain the emotions of the palestinians it is a book that was solely written for those who want to know what it means to be a palestinian it is an epistle to the world and the privileged this book is a mnemonic to us about how privileged superficial and empty hearted we are and how the whole world has decided to let palestinians suffer by themselves after reading this book you will love palestine beirut you will learn how precious life is how these worldly mundane desires aren t worthy at all how our depression is nothing compared to the sleepless nights palestinians lead how our privileged sadness is nothing compared to the women who had to see their offsprings getting taken by the brutal soldiers how the soldiers cut the belly of the pregnant women how the father the husband has to witness his beloved wife son daughter unborn child getting martyred and you will hate the whole world for allowing something this brutal,1,0.63,0.37,0.63,0.37

just finished frankenstein by mary shelley i recently finished frankenstein and loved the book the themes and the story was really good but i still don t get one thing i have read from many places that in the book real monster was victor frankenstein himself but i still don t get how yes he was responsible for the monster he created him and then abandoned him instead of helping him talking about the monster people say that the monster killed people because of frankenstein but i think it s not that simple when the monster killed william it was not because that frankenstein abandoned him i think that he was angry because of his previous incident with the de lacey family and when he heard the name frankenstein from william he just had an excuse to do his deed a friend of mine also said that the monster just wanted a companion and frankenstein refused that also which forced him to kill more people to that i would like to say that frankenstein did try to make the companion but he stopped because i think he was right to fear that what if the next creature had her own free will and she didn t want to live with the monster wouldn t then the original creature get angry and then try to kill frankenstein or worse i am also not saying that frankenstein was innocent he was partially responsible for the deaths around him but to label him a monster is very extreme in my opinion in fact he was a deeply flawed human just like every other human that faced the monster in the novel and if that makes frankenstein a monster i believe then every other person is also a monster what are your thoughts on who was the monster i would love to know and i am not a literary genius this is my rd classic and if i have missed something do tell me,1,0.88,0.12,0.88,0.12

would you want an author to tell you if a completed series continues in a new book an author wrote a series i love the series started ended and life moved on he has a new series i read the book which included a rare afterword section in it he said this book was in the same universe as his other series i really enjoyed the book so was planning on reading the next entry in the series no matter what i keep going back and forth on whether him telling us the readers that the books are linked is a good thing or a bad thing good people who haven t read the other series might be more inclined to read it as i am reading my mind will look for patterns and clues linking the stories making the experience more engrossing and enriching bad spoilers i don t get to experience that elusive lightbulb moment when i realize the stories are in the same universe what do you think would you want an author to tell you if a series you love is continuing from a different angle or would you rather be surprised by discovering it as the story progresses i don t want say which author or series because i don t want to spoil anything for anyone who doesn t read the afterword,1,0.94,0.06,0.94,0.06000000000000005
older books often written from first person i ve gotten heavily into reading this past year and i ve been visiting old classics i ve noticed that authors like lovecraft poe bradbury hg wells and more often write as if the character is giving their testiment of events does anyone know if there s a distinct moment when the style changed to becoming more third person or am i just simply running into first person more often but there s nothing to it,1,0.88,0.12,0.88,0.12

reading oryx and crake in the aftermath of was quite a a trip spoilers below i just finished reading oryx and crake by margaret atwood for the first time and it really blew me away i had heard polarizing things about it it seems to be a love it or hate it kind of novel but reading it in the aftermath of the gt covid pandemic lt and the various environmental crises in the news today made it hit really hard possibly moreso than if i had read it when it was written back in the s before the world felt quite so wildly off kilter a few things that really stood out to me the first was crake and jimmy s teenage years of trolling around the internet while i definitely wasn t exposed to anything as terrible as hotttotts or brainfrizz as a dude who spent way too much time unsupervised on the early internet before facebook s walled garden subsumed everything i really identified with the casual sociopathy caused by seeing shocking content mediated by a screen you see enough terrible stuff online and just kind of become inured to it which leaves you kind of feeling corroded and hollow inside after a while the flashback sequence where gt crake s plague takes over the world gave me vivid flashbacks to the early days of covid the lockdowns the scramble for vaccines the arrogance of pundits right up until the threat became real it gave me a vivid feeling of there but for the grade of god go we lt finally the looming backdrop of increasing environmental collapse that the wealthy people in the compounds can avoid really resonated with my own climate related anxieties i ve been watching canada and the pnw of the us get cooked by temperatures sometimes degrees f higher than the usual average for this time of year and the resulting wildfires and wondering is this it have we gone from climate change to climate crisis to climate catastrophe combine that with anxiety about california running out of water for good and i m wondering if soon we ll all be eating soyoboy french fries and eating chickienobbs grown in tubes anyway that s my rant about oryx and crake on to year of the flood and maddaddam if the existential anxiety doesn t get me first has anyone else recently revisited these books i m curious how people who first read them back in the s might feel about revisiting them now that the predicted dystopia feels so much realer,1,0.81,0.19,0.81,0.18999999999999995
child support am i overreacting so baby dad picked up my daughter months old tonight as he does every weekend he said he wanted to talk about putting a formal child support plan in action so far he put half towards baby things before she was born but hasn t paid anything regular since she was born i haven t asked for anything but he transfer a large sum of money into my account at random at around weeks old i know that i can t depend on this man for anything and that s why i haven t bothered to ask for child support he left me in the worst possible situation already i m not going to put myself in that position again however i was feeling nice today so heard the man out and even made him a cup of coffee he normally doesn t get through the front door he outlined what he thought was reasonable to pay weekly given his wage and his own circumstances and detailed how he wanted to make it official in writing okay not a problem legally binding contract means that if he doesn t pay up i take him to court then then he has the cheek to say i want to see receipts though i want to know that you re spending my money on our daughter and not getting your hair and nails done on me the absolute gall of this man this man wants to see receipts he wants a run down of my finances and what i spend my money on this man that picked up and left mid way through my pregnancy still wants a say on what i do with my money it s not as if i get my hair or nails done anyways like i did it whilst i was pregnant or before i was pregnant i used to get them done for special occasions or as a treat i don t do that shit because i can t afford that shit how he didn t leave my house wearing that cup of coffee is beyond me so no longer feeling nice i not so politely told him to shove his money up his arse and that i don t want it i told him he was an unreliable flaky piece of shit that i couldn t depend on to save my life i may be struggling for money right now but i would rather struggle than accept his money on his terms and depend on him again i then suggested if he wanted to contribute to his daughter he should deposit the money into a bank account for her for when she turns i don t want a penny of his money if he s going to use it against me god i am so angry i love my daughter to death but i wish literally any other man on this planet was her father than that waste of fucking space also my step father has told me that i was stupid and should have taken his money he thinks that i m over reacting so i guess i m here to ask that but mostly here to rant about that piece of shit that impregnated me am i over reacting,0,0.12,0.88,0.12,0.12

need help figuring this out i m am trying to figure out how to go about this or if i should even go about it at all i ll try to make this as short as possible i have a f daughter when she was born i learned that her mother was sleeping with someone else at the time of conception possibly multiple people we split up when my daughter was years old she did everything in her will to try and keep me from my daughter legally and not so legally it was a constant battle that i was losing and i was tired of fighting when my daughter was years old i signed my rights over and her husband at the time adopted her at the time i asked my daughter if that s what she wanted and she said yes plus the guy was a really awesome guy that genuinely did care for my daughter and i knew she would be in good hands with him keep in mind i had a very limited relationship with her growing up fast forward when my daughter turned she reached out to me and surprisingly wanted to have a relationship with me keep in mind that this child was brainwashed to believe that i am the devil himself regardless our relationship has been great since then it s not exactly the relationship that i want but i ll take what i can get i m just happy that she is a part of my life anyways i have days where i soooo badly want to tell her how her mother was with me i want to tell her how she would tell me that she wished we were dead how she kept me from seeing her and would fight with me every opportunity she had the death threats etc i also want to tell her that even though i think of her as mine there is a possibility that she is not mine not just for selfish reasons but what if she has some sort of medical condition someday that may be hereditary from the other guy or guys considering she wouldn t happen to be mine part of me doesn t want to know but i find myself repeatedly thinking about it also i worry that if i bring any of this up to my daughter she will want nothing to do with me anymore if i were her i would definitely want to know what should i do,0,0.18,0.82,0.18,0.18
